This folder is scheduled to store documentation.

* extGraph contains external graphics used in documentation.

If you run docCreate.m in folder code:
* index.html is created and
* html is filled with reference files.

I.e. the content of html and the file index.html could be deleted and rebuilded by running docCreate.
