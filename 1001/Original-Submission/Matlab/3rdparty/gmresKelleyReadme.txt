Third Party Code:

This toolbox contains third-party code:

gmresKelley.m

This GMRES by Kelley is faster than the standard GMRES.

(As third party code we store it in the folder 3rdparty. Otherwise we would store it in the folder proc/operators/.)

This method is described in Ch. 3.4 of the following book:
C. Tim Kelley. Iterative Methods for Linear and Nonlinear Equations. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 1995.
