<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>  Introduction   </H1> 
 
SPRNG is a set of libraries for scalable and portable pseudorandom 
number generation, and has been developed keeping in mind the 
requirements of users involved in parallel Monte Carlo simulations. 
<P> 
Monte Carlo calculations consume a large fraction of all 
supercomputing cycles. The accuracy of these 
computations is critically influenced by the quality of the random 
number generators used. While the issue of random number generation in 
sequential calculations has been well studied, albeit on less 
powerful computers, there has been 
comparatively less work done in the context of parallel Monte Carlo 
applications. SPRNG seeks to fill this gap by implementing parallel 
random number generators that satisfy the requirements given below. 
<P> 
<H2>Desiderata for parallel random number generators</H2> 
Users generally desire the following from any parallel random number generator: 
<DL> 
<DT><A HREF="definitions.html#quality">Quality:</A> <BR> 
<BR> 
  <DD>Provide ``high quality'' pseudorandom numbers in a 
      computationally inexpensive and scalable manner. <BR> 
<BR> 
 
<DT><A HREF="definitions.html#reproducibility">Reproducibility:</A> <BR> 
<BR> 
  
  <DD>Provide totally reproducible <A HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> of parallel 
      pseudorandom numbers, independent of the number of processors used in the 
computation and of the loading produced by sharing of the parallel computer. <BR> 
<BR> 
 
<DT><A HREF="definitions.html#locality">Locality:</A> <BR> 
<BR> 
 
  <DD>Allow for the creation of unique pseudorandom number streams 
on a parallel machine with minimal interprocessor communication. <BR> 
<BR> 
 
<DT><A HREF="definitions.html#portability">Portability:</A> <BR> 
<BR> 
 
<DD>Should be portable between serial and parallel platforms and 
must be available on the most commonly used workstations and supercomputers. <BR> 
</DL> 
<BR> 
SPRNG provides pseudorandom number generators that satisfy the above 
requirements.<P> 
<H2>Generators implemented in SPRNG</H2> 
With the above goals in mind, SPRNG provides user-friendly interfaces for 
parallel FORTRAN and C programs which enables the user to easily 
obtain sufficiently uncorrelated pseudorandom number streams on 
different processors, with minimal inter-processor 
communication. Furthermore, the user can generate random numbers from 
more than one stream on each processor. 
 
<P> 
 The 
generators implemented in SPRNG are (i) two versions of <A HREF="generators.html#lcg48">Linear Congruential with Prime Addend</A> 
and (ii) <A HREF="generators.html#lfg">modified Additive Lagged 
Fibonacci</A> (iii) <A HREF="generators.html#mlfg">Multiplicative Lagged 
Fibonacci</A> (iv) <A HREF="generators.html#cmrg">Combined Multiple Recursive Generator</A> (v) <A HREF="generators.html#pmlcg">Prime Modulus Linear Congruential Generator</A>. 
<P> 
<H2>SPRNG functionality</H2> 
SPRNG provides more functionality than just the ability to generate 
independent streams on different processors. We mention two of these and 
their applications below. (i) In order to balance the 
load the user may want to assign the computations involving a 
particular random number stream to a different process. A user may 
also want to <A HREF="definitions.html#checkpoint"><EM>check-point</EM></A> the program. SPRNG facilitates these tasks by 
enabling the user to obtain the state of a stream in a <STRONG>machine
 independent</STRONG> format using the functions <SAMP>(un)pack_sprng</SAMP>. (ii) In some 
branching computations, new generators are <A HREF="definitions.html#spawn"><EM>spawned</EM></A> from old 
ones. SPRNG enables the spawning of new streams while ensuring 
their independence from streams on any of the processors, with minimal 
inter-processor communication. Further details on the functionality 
provided by SPRNG is given in the section on <A 
HREF="usage.html">SPRNG usage</A>. 
<P> 
<H2>SPRNG features</H2> 
In order to be accessible to a wide spectrum of supercomputer users, SPRNG 
has the following features:

<DD><A HREF="languages.html#C">C</A> and <A 
HREF="languages.html#fortran">FORTRAN</A> interfaces are 
available. SPRNG is also callable from <A

<DT><A HREF="message-passing.html">Message Passing:</A> <BR> 
<BR> 
  
<DD>Support is available for programs using <A HREF="message-passing.html#mpi">MPI</A> for message passing. Support for 
<A HREF="message-passing.html#pvm">PVM</A> may be added in later versions. However, PVM programs can still 
use the current version. <BR> 
<BR> 
 
<DT><A HREF="test-suite.html">Test Suite:</A>  <BR> 
<BR> 
 
<DD>A test suite with statistical tests and tests based on physical

<BR> 
 
<DT><A HREF="platforms.html">Platforms:</A>  <BR> 
<BR> 
 
<DD>SPRNG has been ported to CRAY T3E, HP/Convex Exemplar, IBM SP2, 
SGI-CRAY Origin 2000 and SGI Power 
Challenge parallel computers. It has also been ported to HP and SUN 
workstations, and also to PCs running Linux.  <BR> 
 
<P> 
<DT><A HREF="newgen.html">Extensibility:</A>  <BR> 
<BR> 
 
<DD>SPRNG is easy to extend, and new parallel generators can easily be 
developed to support SPRNG features.<BR>
