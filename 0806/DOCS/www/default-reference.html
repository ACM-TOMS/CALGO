<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Default Interface</H1> 
 
In this section, we give detailed descriptions of each SPRNG 
function call with the default interface. This interface would typically be used if 
more than one random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A> is needed on any 
process.  
<P> 
 
<H2>Pointers for FORTRAN users</H2> 
The different random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> available on a 
process are distinguished by unique <A 
HREF="definitions.html#ID"><EM>ID's</EM></A>, which are implemented as pointers 
to the memory locations where the <A 
HREF="definitions.html#state"><EM>states</EM></A> of the 
respective streams are stored. Since standard FORTRAN 77 does not have 
a pointer 
type, we can store a pointer as an integer of the same size as a C 
pointer.  We have defined a <A 
HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> called  <A 
HREF="macros.html"><SAMP>SPRNG_POINTER</SAMP></A> in the file <A 
HREF="sprng.html#sprngf"><SAMP>sprng_f.h</SAMP></A> that 
automatically defines an integer of the correct size on the 
platforms on which SPRNG is supported. A FORTRAN programmer can then 
use the type <SAMP>SPRNG_POINTER</SAMP> just as if it were a FORTRAN data 
type. However, this applies only if the FORTRAN program is <A HREF="languages.html#fortran">compiled</A> with the same flags as given in the <A 
HREF="makefile.html">make file</A> that comes with SPRNG. 
 
<H2>Terminology</H2> 
In the following description, an argument marked as IN indicates that 
the argument, or array elements pointed to by that argument, are 
read by the function, but not modified. OUT indicates that the 
argument, or array elements pointed to by that argument, are written 
into by the function, but that its values are not used by the 
function. Arguments that are both read and modified are denoted by INOUT. 
 
<H2> SPRNG Functions</H2> 
We describe below the SPRNG function calls available in the default 
interface. For each function, the C call is given first, followed by 
the FORTRAN  
call. The data type preceding the function name is the type 
returned by the function. The data types preceding the arguments to the 
functions are the data types of the corresponding function arguments.

<BR> 
<DD> <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP> initializes random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A>. <BR> 
<BR> 
 <SAMP>nstreams</SAMP> is the number of 
     distinct streams  that will be initialized across all 
     the processes and must be greater than 0. Otherwise it is reset to 1 and a 
     warning message is sent to <SAMP><A HREF="definitions.html#stderr"><EM>stderr</EM></A></SAMP> stating that the 
     number of streams has been reset.<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<CODE>streamnum</CODE> is the stream 
   number, typically the processor number, and must be in 
     [0,nstreams-1]. If it is not in the acceptable range, 
     then an error message is sent to <SAMP>stderr</SAMP> and the function 
     returns a <A HREF="definitions.html#null"><EM>NULL</EM></A> 
     pointer. Note that the <A HREF="generators.html">number of independent streams</A>   for each 
     type of generator is limited (but at least 10<SUP>5</SUP>). If <CODE>streamnum</CODE> is larger 
     than this number, then a warning message is sent to stderr 
     stating that the independence of streams cannot be guaranteed.<BR> 
<BR> 
 
 
<SAMP>seed</SAMP> is the 
     <A HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> to the random 
     number generator. It is not the starting <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#state"><EM>state</EM></A> of the 
     sequence; rather, it is an encoding of the starting state. It 
     is acceptable (and recommended) to use the 
     same seed for all the streams. Distinct streams are returned 
     based on their seed and the stream number.  Only the 31 least significant 
     bits of <SAMP>seed</SAMP> are used in determining the initial 
     starting state of the stream. Higher order bits 
     that are set will be ignored. No warning message is printed if 
     the higher order bits are set.<BR> 
<BR> 
The argument <A 
     HREF="parameters.html"><SAMP>param</SAMP></A> selects the 
     appropriate parameters (for example, the multiplier for a Linear 
     Congruential Generator or the lag for a Lagged Fibonacci 
     Generator).  The <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> 
     <SAMP>SPRNG_DEFAULT</SAMP>, <A HREF="macros.html">defined</A>  in the 
     SPRNG <A HREF="definitions.html#header"><EM>header files</EM></A>, can be used to choose the 
     default parameters. If an invalid parameter is passed to this function, 
     then a warning message is sent to <SAMP>stderr</SAMP> and the default 
     parameter is used.<BR> 
<BR> 
<SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP> 
     returns the <A HREF="definitions.html#ID"><EM>ID</EM></A>  of the stream when it completes successfully. If 
     it fails due to incorrect arguments or inability to allocate 
     memory, then an error message is sent to <SAMP>stderr</SAMP> and a 
     <SAMP>NULL</SAMP> pointer is returned.  <BR>

<DD> This function produces a new <A

information. It will typically be used when the programmer wishes to 
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialize</EM></A>  with a
different seed every time the program is run.   User should note that
both the Lagged Fibonacci 
     Generators requires the use of the same seed for each stream in 
     order to guarantee their <A HREF="definitions.html#independence"><EM>independence</EM></A>. In order to ensure 
     this on a parallel computer, they should install the <A 
     HREF="message-passing.html#mpi">MPI</A> version of SPRNG  
     and <A HREF="macros.html">define</A> the <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A>

<BR> 
If the user has installed the MPI version of the library but has not 
defined the macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP>, then the seed could be different 
on the different processes. No warning message is printed. If the 
user has not installed the MPI version of the library but includes the 
macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP>, then link time errors will be reported by 
the compiler.<BR> 
<BR> 
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If users have installed the MPI version of the 
library and defined the macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP>, then they must 
call <SAMP>MPI_Init</SAMP> before making calls to 
<SAMP>make_sprng_seed</SAMP>. The user should also call 
<SAMP>MPI_Finalize</SAMP> later. SPRNG does not make either of these 
calls. If any process calls <SAMP>make_sprng_seed</SAMP>, then users 
should ensure that all their processes call this function, since 
collective MPI operations are performed here.<BR>

<BR> 
<SAMP>fbuffer</SAMP> should be  the first element of an array of size <SAMP>MAX_PACKED_LENGTH</SAMP> 
bytes, where <SAMP>MAX_PACKED_LENGTH</SAMP> is a <A 
HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> <A 
HREF="macros.html">defined</A>  in <SAMP>"sprng_f.h"</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>"sprng.h"</SAMP>.  If the memory in the array is insufficient, 
undetected errors could occur. It might also lead to segmentation 
faults. In the C interface, the programmer need not 
allocate memory. SPRNG allocates memory for the 
array and has the result stored in <SAMP>*buffer</SAMP>.  
<BR>

 Calls to this 
function in C or FORTRAN involve memory allocation within this 
function. In case of insufficient memory, an error message is sent to 
<tt>stderr</tt> and the value 0 is returned. 
<BR> 
<BR> 
This function can be used for <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#checkpoint"><EM>check-pointing</EM></A>, where the programmer 
     packs the state of the stream into an array and then saves it 
     to a file. This state can later be retrieved by calling 
     <SAMP>unpack_sprng</SAMP>, which is explained below. <SAMP>pack_sprng</SAMP> can also be 
     used to pass a stream to another process. That process will 
     unpack the packed array to obtain the stream. <BR> 
<BR> 
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> SPRNG does not free the memory associated with 
a stream when it packs it. If users do not plan to use 
the stream that has been packed, then they can explicitly call 
<SAMP>free_sprng</SAMP> in order to free the memory.<BR>

     HREF="definitions.html#state"><EM>state</EM></A>      through a call to the function <SAMP>pack_sprng</SAMP>. An 
     <A HREF="definitions.html#ID"><EM>ID</EM></A>  for the recreated stream is returned. Note that this ID is 
     unrelated to the previous  
     ID of the stream before it was packed, though the states are 
     the same. <BR> 
<BR> 
 Calls to this function involve memory allocation. In 
     case sufficient memory was not obtained, an error message is 
     sent to <A HREF="definitions.html#stderr"><EM>stderr</EM></A>  and the <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#null"><EM>NULL</EM></A>  pointer is 
     returned. The packed string must be the state of a valid 
     stream. If it is not, the error may not necessarily be 
     detected by SPRNG. If an error is detected, then an error message 
     is sent to <SAMP>stderr</SAMP> and a <SAMP>NULL</SAMP> pointer is
