<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Generators </H1> 
<P> 
 
<A NAME="cmrg"></A>  
<H2>1. Combined Multiple Recursive Generator</H2> 
<P> 
This generator is defined by the following relation:<BR><BR> 
z(n) = x(n) + y(n)*2<SUP>32</SUP> (Mod 2<SUP>64</SUP>)<BR><BR> 
where x(n) is the sequence generated by the <A 
HREF="#lcg64">64 bit Linear Congruential Generator</A> and y(n) is the
sequence generated by the following prime modulus Multiple Recursive Generator:<BR><BR>  
y(n) = 107374182*y(n-1) + 104480*y(n-5) (mod 2147483647)<BR><BR> 
 
The same prime modulus generator is used for all the streams. Streams differ due to differences in the 64 bit LCG. 
<P> 
The <STRONG>period</STRONG> of this generator is around 
<SAMP>2<SUP>219</SUP></SAMP>. The <STRONG>number of distinct 
streams</STRONG> available is over 
<SAMP>10<SUP>8</SUP></SAMP>. 
 
<P> 
The multiplier <EM>a</EM> for the 64 bit LCG 
 is a <A HREF="parameters.html">parameter</A> to this generator and can be set during 
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A>.  
<P> 
When a call to <SAMP>isprng</SAMP> is made, the 31 high order bits of 
<SAMP>z(n)</SAMP> are returned. When a call to <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> is 
made, the result obtained is <SAMP>z(n)/2<SUP>64</SUP></SAMP>.  
<P> 
 
<A NAME="lcg48"></A>  
<H2>2. 48 Bit Linear Congruential Generator with Prime Addend</H2> 
<P> 
The recurrence relation for the sequence of random numbers produced by 
this generator is given by 
the following recurrence:  
<P> 
<SAMP>x(n) = a x(n-1) + p (Mod M)</SAMP> 
<P> 
where <SAMP>x(n)</SAMP> is the <SAMP>n</SAMP> th term in the sequence, 
<EM>p</EM> is a 
prime number and <EM>a</EM> is the multiplier. The value of 
<EM>M</EM> for this generator is 2<SUP>48</SUP>.  
<P> 
Different random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> are obtained by 
choosing different prime numbers as the addend <EM>p</EM>. There are 
theoretical results by <A HREF="refs.html#percus">Percus and Kalos</A>  which suggest that such a 
choice will yield reasonably <A 
HREF="definitions.html#independence"><EM>independent</EM></A> 
streams. We have <A HREF="tests.html">tested</A> this generator 
empirically too.  
<P> 
The <STRONG>period</STRONG> of this generator is <SAMP>2<SUP>48</SUP></SAMP>. The <STRONG>number of distinct 
streams</STRONG> available is of the order of <SAMP>2<SUP>19</SUP></SAMP>. However, it is 
possible to exhaust the set of distinct streams quite fast if the user 
spawns streams too often. The distinct streams provided are more 
independent, as 
per the 
theoretical analysis mentioned above, if the addends  
are large prime numbers. Thus 
we provide streams with primes taken from the the high end of the 
range during initialization.  
 
<P> 
The multiplier 
<EM>a</EM> is a <A HREF="parameters.html">parameter</A> to this generator and can be set during 
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A>.  
<P> 
When a call to <SAMP>isprng</SAMP> is made, the 31 high order bits of 
<SAMP>x(n)</SAMP> are returned. When a call to <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> is 
made, the result obtained is <SAMP>x(n)/M</SAMP>.  
<P> 
Initialization with different <A 
HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seeds</EM></A>  starts the 
generator at different points in the sequence. 
<P> 
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The low order bits of this sequence have a 
small period. Therefore, if users utilizes certain bits of the 
sequence in order to take certain decisions in their algorithm, they 
should avoid using the low order bits. 
<P> 
This generator also has correlations between elements of the sequence 
separated by powers of two. So users should avoid using numbers n at 
a time where n is a power of two (such as 1024).  
<P> 
 
<A NAME="lcg64"></A>  
<H2>3. 64 Bit Linear Congruential Generator with Prime Addend</H2> 
<P> 
The features of this generator are similar to the <A 
HREF="#lcg48">48 bit Linear Congruential Generator</A>, except that 
the arithmetic is modulo 2<SUP>64</SUP>. The <A 
HREF="parameters.html">multipliers</A> and prime addends <EM>p</EM> for this generator are 
different from those for the 48 bit generator. 
<P> 
The <STRONG>period</STRONG> of this generator is 
<SAMP>2<SUP>64</SUP></SAMP>. The <STRONG>number of distinct 
streams</STRONG> available is over 
<SAMP>10<SUP>8</SUP></SAMP>. 
 
 
<A NAME="lfg"></A>  
<H2>4. Modified Lagged Fibonacci Generator</H2> 
The recurrence relation for this sequence of random numbers is given by 
the following equation:  
<P> 
<SAMP>z(n) = x(n) XOR y(n)</SAMP> 
<P> 
where <SAMP>XOR</SAMP> is the <EM>exclusive-or</EM> operator, <SAMP>x</SAMP> and <SAMP>y</SAMP> are sequences obtained from 
Lagged Fibonacci sequences <SAMP>X</SAMP> and <SAMP>Y</SAMP> of the following form: 
<P> 
<SAMP>X(n) = X(n-k) + X(n-l) (mod M)</SAMP><BR> 
<SAMP>Y(n) = Y(n-k) + Y(n-l) (mod M)</SAMP><BR> 
<P> 
<EM>l</EM> and <EM>k</EM> are called the lags of the generator, and we 
use the convention that <EM>l > k</EM>. M is 
chosen to be 2<SUP>32</SUP>. <SAMP>X(n)</SAMP> and <SAMP>Y(n)</SAMP> are 32 
bit integers. <SAMP>x</SAMP> is obtained from <SAMP>X</SAMP> by 
setting the Least Significant Bit of the latter to 
<SAMP>0</SAMP>. <SAMP>y</SAMP> is obtained from <SAMP>Y</SAMP> by 
shifting the latter right by one bit. This modification of the Lagged 
Fibonacci Generator is performed in order to avoid certain 
correlations that are observed in the unmodified generator. 
<P> 
When a call to <SAMP>isprng</SAMP> is made, the 31 high order bits of 
<SAMP>z(n)</SAMP> are returned. When a call to <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> is 
made, the result obtained is <SAMP>z(n)/M</SAMP>.  
<P> 
 
The <STRONG>period</STRONG> of this generator is 
<SAMP>2<SUP>31</SUP>(2<SUP>l</SUP>-1)</SAMP> where <VAR>l</VAR> is the lag. For the 
default generator with lag <SAMP>l = 1279</SAMP>, the period is 
approximately <SAMP>2<SUP>1310</SUP></SAMP>. The <STRONG>number of distinct streams</STRONG> 
available is <SAMP>2<SUP>[31(l-1)-1]</SUP></SAMP>. For the default generator this 
gives <SAMP>2<SUP>39648</SUP></SAMP> distinct streams. However, users should 
still be cautious while spawning new streams, since it is possible to 
exhaust the set of distinct streams even without using all of them if they 
 spawn often from only a few of the original streams. 
 
<P> 
The sequence obtained is determined by the <EM>l</EM> initial values 
of the sequences <SAMP>X</SAMP> and <SAMP>Y</SAMP>.  
The <A HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> used during 
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A> for 
this generator does not move one to a different point in the 
sequence. Rather, it returns a different sequence. The seeding 
algorithms ensures that if the same seed is used for all the <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A>, 
then the streams obtained are <A 
HREF="definitions.html#independence"><EM>independent</EM></A>. If a 
user initializes  different streams with different seeds, then it is 
possible that the same sequence may be assigned to two different 
streams and hence we may no longer have independent streams. Thus it 
is important to use the same seed while initializing all the streams 
with this generator. <A HREF="tests.html">Test 
results</A> for this generator's <A 
HREF="definitions.html#quality"><EM>quality</EM></A> are also 
available. 
<P> 
The <A HREF="parameters.html">parameters</A> to this generator are the 
values of the lags. More details on this generator and the seeding 
algorithms can be found papers by <A HREF="refs.html#mascagni1">Mascagni, et al</A>. 
 
<P> 
 
 
 
<A NAME="mlfg"></A>  
<H2>5. Multiplicative Lagged Fibonacci Generator</H2> 
The recurrence relation for this sequence of random numbers is given by 
the following equation:  
<P> 
<SAMP>x(n) = x(n-k) * x(n-l) (mod M)</SAMP><BR> 
<P> 
<EM>l</EM> and <EM>k</EM> are called the lags of the generator, and we 
use the convention that <EM>l > k</EM>. M is 
chosen to be 2<SUP>64</SUP>.  
<P> 
When a call to <SAMP>isprng</SAMP> is made, the 31 high order bits of 
<SAMP>x(n)</SAMP> are returned. When a call to <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> is 
made, the result obtained is <SAMP>x(n)/M</SAMP>.  
<P> 
 
The <STRONG>period</STRONG> of this generator is 
<SAMP>2<SUP>61</SUP>(2<SUP>l</SUP>-1)</SAMP> where <VAR>l</VAR> is the lag. For the 
default generator with lag <SAMP>l = 17</SAMP>, the period is 
approximately <SAMP>2<SUP>81</SUP></SAMP>. The <STRONG>number of distinct streams</STRONG> 
available is <SAMP>2<SUP>[63(l-1)-1]</SUP></SAMP>. For the default generator this 
gives around <SAMP>2<SUP>1008</SUP></SAMP> distinct streams. However, users should 
still be cautious while spawning new streams, since it is possible to 
exhaust the set of distinct streams even without using all of them if they 
 spawn often from only a few of the original streams. 
 
<P> 
The sequence obtained is determined by the <EM>l</EM> initial values 
of the sequence <SAMP>x</SAMP>.  
The <A HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> used during 
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A> for 
this generator does not move one to a different point in the 
sequence. Rather, it returns a different sequence. The seeding 
algorithms ensures that if the same seed is used for all the <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A>, 
then the streams obtained are <A 
HREF="definitions.html#independence"><EM>independent</EM></A>. If a 
user initializes  different streams with different seeds, then it is 
possible that the same sequence may be assigned to two different 
streams and hence we may no longer have independent streams. Thus it 
is important to use the same seed while initializing all the streams 
with this generator. <A HREF="tests.html">Test 
results</A> for this generator's <A 
HREF="definitions.html#quality"><EM>quality</EM></A> are also 
available. 
<P> 
The <A HREF="parameters.html">parameters</A> to this generator are the 
values of the lags. More details on this generator and the seeding
algorithm will be given shortly.

<H2>6. Prime Modulus Linear Congruential Generator</H2> 
<P> 
This generator is defined by the following relation:<BR><BR> 
x(n) = a*x(n-1) (mod 2<SUP>61</SUP>-1)<BR><BR> 
where the multiplier <EM>a</EM> differs for each stream. The mulitpler is chosen to be certain powers of 37 that give maximal period cycles of acceptable quality. 
 
The only acceptable <A HREF="parameters.html">parameter</A> to this generator during <A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A> is the value <SAMP>SPRNG_DEFAULT</SAMP>. 
<P> 
The <STRONG>period</STRONG> of this generator is  
<SAMP>2<SUP>61</SUP>-2</SAMP>. The <STRONG>number of distinct 
streams</STRONG> available is roughly 2<SUP>58</SUP>. 
 
<P> 
This generator is not installed automatically while installing SPRNG. In order to install it, please first install the GNU multiprecision arithmetic library <SAMP>libgmp.a</SAMP> in the same location as other SPRNG libraries. Then please change directory to <SAMP>sprng/SRC/pmlcg</SAMP> and type <SAMP>make</SAMP>.
