<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>  Statistical Tests  </H1> 
<P> 
The basic 
idea behind the statistical tests of randomness is that the random number 
streams obtained from a generator should have the properties of a 
sample drawn from a uniform distribution. Tests are designed so that 
the expected value of some test statistic is known for the uniform 
distribution. The empirically generated random number stream  is 
then subjected to the same test, and the statistic obtained is compared 
against the expected value. While a boundless number of tests can be 
constructed, certain tests have become popular and are accepted as the 
 
de facto standard. Generators that pass such tests are considered 
"good". The series of tests proposed by <A 
HREF="refs.html#knuth">Knuth</A> and the <A 
HREF="refs.html#diehard">DIEHARD</A> tests implemented by 
Marsaglia are practically considered the standard tests.  
<P> 
These tests check a random number stream for the uniformity of the 
stream and for correlations between numbers in the stream. In a 
parallel random number generator, we include the additional 
restriction that there should not be correlations between different random 
number streams. For example, it should not so happen that most of the 
random numbers streams generate high random numbers in similar 
positions.  If we interleave two streams such that the 
new stream generated has alternate numbers from the same stream, then 
this new stream should pass the tests for a serial random number 
stream if the original streams were not correlated. This testing scheme can be 
generalized to interleaving several streams to form a new stream.

<H2>Sequential Tests</H2> 
<DD>These tests were proposed by <A 
HREF="refs.html#knuth">Knuth</A> and are widely used to check  the 
<A HREF="definitions.html#quality"><EM>quality</EM></A> of the random 
number streams.  
<P> 
We tested several streams from our our random number generators, 
producing a total of around 10<SUP>11</SUP> random numbers for each 
test given below. The test statistics obtained for all the streams 
were then subjected to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The results were 
considered acceptable if they were not in the 1% tails.  Our 
generators pass all these tests. 
<P> 
The <A HREF="test-suite.html#tests">tests</A> performed included the 
following: Coupon collector's test, Equidistribution test, Gap test, 
Maximum of t test, Permutations test, Poker test, Runs test and Serial test. 
</DL> 
<P> 
<H2>Parallel Tests</H2> 
We performed parallel versions of these tests in which we interleaved 
several streams at a time. We give details for the serial test below.

We also parallelized the set of tests described above in which we 
interleaved 256 streams to produce a new stream. In the preliminary 
tests, we generated a total of 10<SUP>8</SUP> random numbers in each 
test. We also performed the runs test and 
the gap test in which we tested 4 sets of 256 streams each for a total of 
1024 streams, generating about 10<SUP>12</SUP> random numbers in the 
process. Both our generators passed these parallel tests.  
 
<DL> 
<DT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=RED>Sum of distributions test:</FONT> 
<DD>We can use the fact that the sum of independent variables approaches 
the normal distribution to test for the independence of random number 
streams. We add random numbers from several streams and form a sum. We 
generate several such sums and check if their distribution is 
normal. In our tests, we formed sums by adding 128 random numbers each 
from 1024 streams. We checked the distribution of 10<SUP>6</SUP> sums 
for a total of around 10<SUP>11</SUP> random numbers. Our generators 
performed acceptably.

<A NAME="diehard"></A> 
<DT><H2>DIEHARD Tests</H2> 
<P> 
<DD>The <A 
HREF="refs.html#diehard">DIEHARD</A> tests were proposed and 
implemented by Marsaglia, and are considered to be more stringent 
tests of randomness than the tests proposed by Knuth. The DIEHARD code is not easy to modify, and so 
we have not modified any of the parameters used in these tests. The 
results of this test indicate that the SPRNG generators perform acceptably.
