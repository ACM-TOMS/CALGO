             ----------------------------------------

             (Section: Testing New Random Number Generators)
Option 1
--------

1. The new generator must define the following three functions:

   int *init_rng(int streamnum, int nstreams, int seed, int param);

   double get_rn_dbl(int *stream);

   int free_rng(int *stream);

      where the streams are parameterized by 'streamnum', that is, different
      streams are produced for different values of 'streamnum'.

2. Install your library "libnewgen.a" in sprng/lib directory.

3. Open file sprng/TESTS/Makefile.
   Add "newgen" to the list on the line "LIBLIST ="... .

4. Type 'make' in sprng/TESTS directory.

Now, each type of test in TESTS has a new version that tests the 
new generator.  The new version has the extension ".newgen".  For
example, to run the equidistribution test on the new generator,
type equidist.newgen.

Option 2
--------

1. Define the macro READ_FROM_STDIN in the file sprng/TESTS/init_tests.c.

2. Type 'make' in the TESTS directory.  

Now the test programs will read input from standard input. If you
redirect stdin from a file with floating point random numbers in ASCII
from your generator, then these numbers will be tested. This procedure
will not, however, work for the Ising model programs (Wolff and
Metropolis.)
