<P> 
This document instructs the user on how to quickly <A 
HREF="install.html">install</A>  and <A HREF="usage.html">use</A>  some of the 
simpler SPRNG features. It assumes that the user has some experience 
installing software and in using random number generators. However, 
links are provided in case more details are required.

<P> 
<UL> 
<UL> 
<LI>Change directory to the <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> directory. For example: 
<P> 
<LI><KBD>cd sprng</KBD> 
<P> 
<LI>Select your platform: Edit the <SAMP>make.CHOICES</SAMP> file -- 
Remove any # sign from in front of the platform you are using, and place one 
in front of all others. Please read the notes on the <A 
HREF="makefile.html">makefile</A> to port SPRNG to other machines.  
<P> 
<LI><KBD>cd SRC</KBD> 
<LI><KBD>make</KBD> 
<BR> 
If you encounter any problems, then please take a look at the <SAMP>make.</SAMP><VAR>PLAT</VAR> file (where PLAT is the platform you are on) to check if the compiler information is set approprately for your machine. If not, you can edit this file and try the <SAMP>make</SAMP> command again. In particular, if you wish to install the MPI version, then you need to edit this file and follow the directions given there.<P> 
<LI><KBD>cd ..</KBD> 
<LI><KBD>./checksprng</KBD><BR> 
Several tests are conducted. The results should show that each of the 
tests passed.  
</UL> 
<P> 
<LI>SPRNG has been correctly installed on your machine. The libraries
are placed in the <SAMP>sprng/lib</SAMP> directory, and the include
files are in <SAMP>sprng/include</SAMP>.

<LI>You may check the <A HREF="timesprng.html">speed</A> of the different SPRNG random number 
generators by executing the following 
command in the directory <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>:

<H2>SPRNG Usage</H2> 
We give some examples to demonstrate the use of some simple features 
of SPRNG. Our examples use the <A HREF="generators.html#lcg48">48 bit 
Linear Congruential Generator</A>. These 
examples assume that the user wishes to use only one random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A> per 
processor. Thus we can make use of the <A 
HREF="usage.html#interfaces">simple interface</A> available on 
SPRNG.  We 
have provided examples for both serial and parallel computers. Further
details, especially for the default interface, can be found in the
<a href="usage.html">usage section</a> of the user's guide. 
<P> 
 Note that the SPRNG libraries
are placed by default in the <SAMP>sprng/lib</SAMP> directory, and the include
files are in <SAMP>sprng/include</SAMP>.
 
<H3>Using SPRNG in a serial program</H3> 
<P> 
<UL> 
<LI>The <A HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> 
<SAMP>SIMPLE_SPRNG</SAMP> should be <A HREF="macros.html">defined</A> 
in order to invoke the simple interface.   
<LI>Then FORTRAN users should <A 
HREF="definitions.html#include"><EM>include</EM></A> the <A 
HREF="definitions.html#header"><EM>header file</EM></A> <A 
HREF="sprng.html#sprngf"><SAMP>sprng_f.h</SAMP></A> and C users <A 
HREF="sprng.html#sprng"><SAMP>sprng.h</SAMP></A>.  
<LI>(Optional) If users wish to, they can call an 
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A> 
function, <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP>. It has two arguments. The first is any integer 
<A HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> and the second 
chooses the <A HREF="parameters.html#lcg48">multiplier parameter</A> for the 
LCG generator. If the user does not call the initialization routine, SPRNG 
performs a default initialization with <SAMP>seed = 0</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>parameter = SPRNG_DEFAULT</SAMP>.  
<LI>The user can then 
call the function <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> in order to obtain a double 
precision random number in [0,1).  
<LI>While compiling, the library <SAMP>liblcg.a</SAMP> should be 
linked.  We have 
provided examples for <A HREF="platforms.html">compilation</A> on 
different platforms.

<LI>The <A HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> 
<SAMP>SIMPLE_SPRNG</SAMP> should be <A HREF="macros.html">defined</A> 
in order to invoke the simple interface.   
<LI>Then the macro 
<SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP> should be defined to instruct SPRNG to make MPI 
calls during initialization.  
<LI>Next FORTRAN users should <A 
HREF="definitions.html#include"><EM>include</EM></A> the <A 
HREF="definitions.html#header"><EM>header file</EM></A> <A 
HREF="sprng.html#sprngf"><SAMP>sprng_f.h</SAMP></A> and C users <A 
HREF="sprng.html#sprng"><SAMP>sprng.h</SAMP></A>.   
<LI>Before calling any 
SPRNG function the users should call <SAMP>MPI_Init</SAMP> and 
finally they must call </SAMP>MPI_Finalize</SAMP>.  
<LI>(Optional) If users wish to, they can call an 
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A> 
function, <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP>. It has two arguments. The first is any integer 
<A HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> and the second

performs a default initialization with <SAMP>seed = 0</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>parameter = SPRNG_DEFAULT</SAMP>. <A 
HREF="definitions.html#independence"><EM>Independent</EM></A> streams 
are produced on each processor. 
<LI>The user can then 
call the function <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> in order to obtain a double 
precision random number in [0,1).  
<LI>While compiling, the libraries 
<SAMP>liblcg.a</SAMP> and the MPI library should be linked.  We have 
provided examples for <A HREF="platforms.html">compilation</A> on 
different platforms.

<H2>Converting User Code to SPRNG</H2> 
<P> 
<UL> 
<LI>Users should <A HREF="macros.html">define</A>  the necessary <A 
HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macros</EM></A> and  <A 
HREF="definitions.html#include"><EM>include</EM></A>  a SPRNG <A 
HREF="definitions.html#header"><EM>header file</EM></A>  
as mentioned in the examples above, in each file where the random number function is called.  
<LI>Then they should replace the 
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A>  calls with a call to <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP> if they 
wish to explicitly perform an initialization. [Optional] 
<LI>In order to replace the 
calls to the users' original random number generator, <VAR>oldrandom</VAR>, with calls to 
<SAMP>sprng</SAMP>, there are two choices: 
<P> 
<OL> 
<LI> Users 
can perform a search and replace in which 
<VAR>oldrandom</VAR> is replaced by <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>. 
<P> 
<LI> Alternatively, users can insert the following line <STRONG>after</STRONG> 
including the SPRNG header file: 
<P> 
<SAMP>#define </SAMP><VAR>oldrandom</VAR> <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> 
</OL> 
<P> 
<LI>Instead of linking to any library for their previous random number 
generator, they must link to <SAMP>liblcg.a</SAMP>.

<P> 
Those FORTRAN users who are not used to the C preprocessor can read the <A HREF="definitions.html#preprocess">note to FORTRAN users</a> on this topic.
