<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Message Passing </H1> 
<P> 
Most SPRNG calls do not require message passing, though SPRNG provides 
utilities to make it easier for users to pass <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> from one process 
to another. Message passing is used by SPRNG only in two cases: (i) 
when the same <A HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A>  is 
required on all the processes in a call to 
<SAMP>make_sprng_seed</SAMP>, this function  
broadcasts a single seed to all the processes and (ii) during 
initialization with the <A HREF="simple-interface.html"> simple interface</A>, SPRNG needs to determine the 
total number of processes and the rank of the local process. 
 
<P> 
<A HNAME="mpi"></A>  
<H2>MPI Version</H2> 
SPRNG uses MPI in order to obtain or broadcast the information 
mentioned in the two cases above. The MPI version of SPRNG provides 
functions that make these calls. This version is obtained by defining 
the macro <SAMP>SPRNG_MPI</SAMP> in the SPRNG <A 
HREF="makefile.html">makefile</A> before building the libraries. Even 
if the MPI version of the library has been installed, SPRNG will make 
MPI calls only when the user <A HREF="macros.html">defines</A> the <A 
HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP> 
before <A HREF="definitions.html#include"><EM>including</EM></A> a 
SPRNG <A HREF="definitions.html#header"><EM>header file</EM></A>. This 
feature enables users to use SPRNG in sequential programs 
even if the MPI version has been installed.  
 
<P> 
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> In the MPI version with <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP> 
defined SPRNG first creates a new communicator when 
<SAMP>make_sprng_seed</SAMP> is called, in order to avoid any 
interference with the users communication calls. Then a new seed on 
the process with rank 0 is created, which is broadcast to all the 
processes. Users should ensure that if any process calls 
<SAMP>make_sprng_seed</SAMP>, then all processes do, in order to 
enable these collective operation to complete. 
 
<P> 
In the simple interface, users running multiple processes should 
define the macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP>, in order to ensure that they 
obtain distinct streams on each process. The reason for this is that 
this interface makes MPI calls to determine the process rank, which is 
used to obtain different streams on the different processes. If the 
above mentioned macro is not used, then MPI calls are not made and the 
process rank is assumed to be <SAMP>0</SAMP> in each process. 
 
<P> 
<A HNAME="pvm"></A>  
<H2>Use with PVM</H2> 
Later versions of SPRNG may have support for PVM too 
available. Currently, PVM users can easily use SPRNG as long as they 
use the <A HREF="default-interface.html"> default interface</A> or the 
interface with <A HREF="checkpointer-interface.html"> pointer checking</A>. In 
order to obtain the same seed on all the processes while using 
<SAMP>make_sprng_seed</SAMP>, they can produce a seed on a single 
process and then pass it explicitly to the other processes.
