<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Creating New Generators in SPRNG Format</H1> 
<P> 
We have made it easy for developers to create new parallel random 
number generators in SPRNG format. The developer just needs to make a copy 
of the file <SAMP>.template.c</SAMP> in the <SAMP>sprng/SRC</SAMP> 
directory and modify the functions <SAMP>init_rng</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>get_rng_dbl</SAMP> which initialize a random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A> and return a double 
precision random number respectively. All other features of SPRNG are 
automatically implemented. 
 
<P> 
<A NAME="scheme"></A>  
<H2>SPRNG Scheme</H2> 
We shall first explain the philosophy behind the SPRNG parallelization 
scheme which should enable others to develop generators along the same 
lines. 
 
<P> 
SPRNG generators maintain a set of <A 
HREF="definitions.html#independence"><EM>independent</EM></A> <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A>. Each stream is 
identified by a unique integer in [0,MAX_STREAMS) where MAX_STREAMS is 
the number of independent streams available. When a user performs an 
initialization, one of these streams is returned. Typically on each 
process the user will initialize a stream identified by the same 
number as the process rank. 
 
<P> 
The user also specifies a <A 
HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> during 
initialization. The initialization routine should return different 
sequences for different seeds. This may be done in various ways. For 
instance, the same stream could be returned but with a different 
starting <A 
HREF="definitions.html#state"><EM>state</EM></A>. Alternatively, the 
developer can shuffle the set of streams in different ways depending 
on the seed, so that the same stream is identified by different 
integers with different seeds. 
 
<P> 
The user also specifies a "parameter". Generators can normally be used 
used with different sets of parameters. For example, the multiplier is 
a parameter for the <A HREF="generators.html#lcg48">48 bit Linear 
Congruential Generator with prime addend</A>, while the lags are 
parameters for the <A HREF="generators.html#lfg">modified Lagged 
Fibonacci Generator</A>. The developer must prepare a list of 
<SAMP>NPARAMS</SAMP> parameter sets that are known to produce highly 
random streams. Each of these is identified with an integer in 
[0,NPARAMS). The user will request an initialization with a parameter 
specified by a number. The parameter set corresponding to that number 
must be then used. In order to help the user remember the parameter 
better, we have define macros that give a name to each parameter. For 
example, SPRNG_DEFAULT is defined to be 0. So if users ask for the SPRNG_DEFAULT 
parameter, then they will get a stream initialized with the first 
parameter in the list, such as the multiplier 
<SAMP>0x2875a2e7b175</SAMP> for the 48 bit Linear Congruential Generator. 
<P> 
 
<H2>Modifying the template</H2> 
We explain below the changes that need to be made to the file 
<SAMP>.template.c</SAMP> in the sprng/SRC directory in order to create a 
new generator. We shall also give an example of the 64 bit Linear 
Congruential Generator with prime addend. This example is written for 
a 64 bit machine in order to simplify the presentation. The actual 
SPRNG generator differs due to optimizations, and also because it is 
generalized to cover 32 bit systems too. 
 
The locations where changes need to be made to .template.c are indicated by comments 
starting with <STRONG>/***</STRONG> in order to make it easy for the developer 
to perform a search. 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>Preliminary steps:</STRONG>  
<OL> 
<LI>Define a string indicating the generator type. This string will be 
used while printing out the information about the random number 
streams. 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>Example 1:</STRONG> 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
#define GENTYPE "64 Bit Linear Congruential Generator" 
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
 
<LI>Define the number of valid parameters. 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>Example 1:</STRONG> 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
#define NPARAMS 3		/*** number of valid parameters ***/ 
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
 
<LI>Define the number of independent streams. If users try to use more 
than these streams, then they will get warning messages stating that 
the independence of streams is not guaranteed. 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>Example 1:</STRONG> 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
int MAX_STREAMS = (1&lt&lt19);  /*** Maximum number of independent streams ***/ 
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
 
<A NAME="struct"></A> 
<LI>Modify the structure <SAMP>rngen</SAMP>. Such a structure is 
associated with each stream initialized. This structure maintains 
information about the state of the stream and also other information 
needed for spawning new streams. Developers should not change anything 
above the line that states: <SAMP>  /*** declare other variables here 
***/</SAMP> before they understand the purpose of these 
variables. While the data structure itself should be modified in the 
preliminary stages, the assignment of values to these variables will 
be done during the initialization. We however mention some aspects of 
these assignments at this stage itself since it is difficult to 
explain the purpose of the variables without actually mentioning what 
kinds of values they will contain. 
 
<P> 
Each random number stream needs to store its state in scalar variables 
or arrays. Developers should declare their scalar variables below the 
line that states<SAMP>  /*** declare other variables here 
***/</SAMP>.  
 
<P> 
<STRONG>Example 1:</STRONG> 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
struct rngen 
{ 
  char *gentype; 
  int stream_number; 
  int nstreams; 
  int init_seed; 
  int parameter; 
  int narrays; 
  int *array_sizes; 
  int **arrays; 
  int spawn_offset; 
  /*** declare other variables here ***/ 
  unsigned long multiplier; 
  unsigned long prime; 
  unsigned long state; 
}; 
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
 
Certain generators such as the lagged Fibonacci Generator require 
arrays to store their information. In that case developers can make 
use of the variables <SAMP>narrays, array_sizes, and 
arrays</SAMP>. <SAMP>narrays</SAMP> is the number of arrays that are 
required. Often this will be just <SAMP>1</SAMP>. If no array is 
required then this will be <SAMP>0</SAMP>. <SAMP>array_sizes</SAMP> 
lists the size of each array. For example, if we have two arrays with 
the first one consisting of 24 integers and the second one consisting 
of 17 integers, then narrays = 2, array_sizes[0] = 24, 
array_sizes[1] = 17. <SAMP>arrays</SAMP> is a pointer to the actual 
set of arrays. <SAMP>arrays[0]</SAMP> in our example is an array of 24 
integers and <SAMP>arrays[1]</SAMP> is of 17 integers. Developers are 
not restricted to using integer types. For example, if they wish to 
use a double precision type with 13 elements, then they can declare a 
variable:<P> 
double *r<P> 
and set the corresponding array_size[i] to 
<SAMP>13*sizeof(double)/sizeof(int)</SAMP> in the initialization 
routine. Then in that routine they can set <SAMP>r = (double *) 
arrays[i]</SAMP>. While this may not be great from a software 
engineering point of view, we feel that people in scientific computing 
are used to even worse practises! 
</OL> 
 
Next the developer has to modify the functions that perform the 
initialization and produce the actual random number. 
 
<OL> 
<LI><STRONG>init_rng:</STRONG> This function follows the specifications 
for <A HREF="default-reference.html#initsprng">init_sprng</A>. We 
have written code that allocates all the memory required. The developer 
still has to write code to initialize some of the data, though. This 
function returns a pointer to the memory location where the data 
concerning the newly initialized stream is located. Though the data 
structure is of type <SAMP>rngen</SAMP>, we convert the pointer to a 
pointer to an <SAMP>int</SAMP> when we return it. 
 
The developer has to perform the following actions: 
 
<OL> 
<LI>Specify the number of arrays as explained <A HREF="#struct">earlier</A>. 
 
<P> 
<STRONG>Example 1:</STRONG> 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
  genptr-&gtnarrays = 0;		/* number of arrays needed by your generator */ 
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
 
<LI>Specify the sizes of the arrays as explained <A HREF="#struct">earlier</A>. 
<P> 
<STRONG>Example (not for the Linear Congruential Generator):</STRONG> 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
  		/* initialize ...array_sizes to the sizes of the arrays */ 
array_sizes[0] = 24; 
array_sizes[1] = 17; 
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
 
<LI> 
Initialize the data in the arrays <SAMP>arrays[1], ..., 
arrays[narrays-1]</SAMP> and in the scalar variables 
based on the requirements of your generator. The initial values will 
typically depend on the argument <SAMP>gennum</SAMP>. 
<P> 
<STRONG>Example 1:</STRONG> 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
  genptr->multiplier = PARAMLIST[param]; 
  genptr->prime = get_prime(gennum); 
  genptr->state = 0xffffffffffffffff^(((unsigned long) seed<<33)|gennum); 
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
 
where <SAMP>get_prime(i)</SAMP> is a function that returns the i th 
prime, and PARAMLIST is an array of multipliers defined as follows: 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
unsigned long PARAMLIST[NPARAMS] = {5015080152056721395UL, 2447899643824353475UL, 
				  10678851390245329133UL}; 
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
 
</OL> 
 
<LI><STRONG>get_rng_dbl:</STRONG> The argument to this function is a 
pointer to the data structure that stores the information concerning a 
random number stream. This function returns a random double precision 
number in (0,1). 
 
<P> 
<OL> 
<STRONG>Example 1:</STRONG> We first multiply the current state by the 
multiplier and add the addend to get the new state. We then multiply 
this by 2<SUP>-64</SUP> to get the desired random number: 
 
<P> 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
/* Returns a double precision random number */ 
 
double get_rn_dbl(int *igenptr) 
{ 
    struct rngen *genptr = (struct rngen *) igenptr; 
 
    genptr->state = genptr-&gtstate*genptr->multiplier + genptr-&gtprime; 
			  /* modulo 64 is automatic in 64 bit arithmetic */ 
    return genptr-&gtstate*FLT_MULT;			 
}  
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
<P> 
where we had 
defined the macro FLT_MULT to be 2<SUP>-64</SUP> earlier: 
<P> 
<PRE> 
<CODE> 
#define FLT_MULT 5.4210108624275222e-20 /* 2^(-64) */ 
</CODE> 
</PRE> 
</OL> 
<P> 
</OL> 
 
<H2>Further Optimization</H2> 
If developers want faster implementations of the functions that return 
random integers and random single precision numbers, then they can 
modify <SAMP>get_rn_int</SAMP> and <SAMP>get_rn_flt</SAMP> 
respectively. 
 
<P> 
Developers may also wish to modify <SAMP>print_rng</SAMP> if they wish 
to print more information than we have provided.
