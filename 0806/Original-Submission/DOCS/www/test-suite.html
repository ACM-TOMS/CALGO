<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Test Suite  </H1> 
<P> 
The SPRNG test suite is available in the TESTS directory under 
sprng. The tests can be divided into two categories, (i) Physical model tests and (ii) Statistical tests. The former are described in the section on <a href="physical-model-tests.html">Physical model tests</a>. The latter are described in this section.  
 
<P> 
We have implemented parallel versions of 
certain popular tests described by <A 
HREF="refs.html#knuth">Knuth</A>. These test can also be used for sequential random number 
generators. We have also provided a few other parallel tests.   
 
Before describing the test suite, we shall provide an overview of 
testing random number generators. 
 
<H2>Testing Random Number Generators</H2> 
Tests of random number generators typically compute some statistic 
from a portion of a random stream. This statistic is compared against 
the expected value from a truly random sample from a uniform 
distribution. If the results from the random number generator are 
consistent with those from a random sample, then the test is said to 
have been "passed" by the random number generator. 
 
Passing a test does not imply that the generator is producing a truly 
random sequence. It just means that that particular test could not 
differentiate between a truly random stream and the stream generated 
by the generator under consideration. However, if several different 
tests are passed, then our confidence in the random number generator 
increases.  
 
Since we need to compare the statistics from the generate stream with 
that from a truly random stream, we need to use some general 
statistical test procedures that can 
compare different distributions. We mention below the 
Chisquare test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which we use 
to determine the likelihood of our random streams coming from a 
uniform distribution. 
 
<P> 
<H3>Chisquare test</H3> 
We can use this test for discrete distributions. Let us assume that we 
have <SAMP>k</SAMP> possible values or "categories" for our variable, 
and that the probability of a sample being of category <SAMP>i</SAMP> 
is <SAMP>p<SUB>i</SUB></SAMP>. We make <SAMP>n</SAMP> independent 
observations and count the number of times each category occurred.  
 
<P> 
For example, we can generate random numbers in (0.0,1.0) and divide 
them into four categories. If the number is less than 0.25, then it 
goes to category 0; if it is between 0.25 and 0.5, then it goes to 
category 1; if it is between 0.5 and 0.75, then it goes to category 2; 
if it is greater than 0.75 then it goes to category 3. Note that 
although the sampled distribution was continuous, we have transformed it 
to a discrete distribution by associating the numbers with their 
categories. The probability for each category is equal to 0.25. We 
count the number of times numbers in each of the four categories 
occur. For <SAMP>n</SAMP> trials, we expect that each category will 
have roughly <SAMP>0.25 x n</SAMP> samples. 
 
<P> 
In general, if category <SAMP>i</SAMP> occurred 
<SAMP>Y<SUB>i</SUB></SAMP> times, then <SAMP>Y<SUB>i</SUB></SAMP> - 
<SAMP>np<SUB>i</SUB></SAMP> is the difference between the observed 
number of values and the expected number of values, and can be 
considered an "error" between the observed and expected quantity. The 
chisquare statistic is a function of these "errors" for each of the 
categories and <SAMP>n</SAMP>. The distribution of the Chisquare 
statistic is known when the number of categories is 
given. We can therefore determine the Chisquare percentile for a given 
chisquare statistic, which is just the proportion of samples from the 
true distribution that have a chisquare statistic less than the 
percentile. 
 
<P> 
For example, if our expected probabilities were computed based on 
samples from a uniform distribution and the chisquare percentile is 
10%, then this means that 10% of random samples drawn from the uniform 
distribution will have chisquare statistics less than what we 
observed. Thus if the chisquare values is very high, say 99%, then it 
is unlikely that our sample came from the uniform distribution, since 
only 1% of the samples from the uniform distribution will have such a 
high value. Less obvious is the fact that even very low values are  
unacceptable. For example, if the chisquare statistic is 1%, this means 
that the observed values were too close to the expected values; even a 
truly random sample from the uniform distribution would have a higher 
chisquare value 99% of the time. 
 
<H3>Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test</H3> 
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is used to compare continuous 
distributions. In this tests, the cumulative distribution function is 
determined for the samples. Then the maximum difference (in absolute 
value) between this distribution and the exact tested distribution is 
computed. The KS statistic is the product of this difference and the 
square root of the number of samples. A high value of this statistic 
therefore indicates that the two distributions are far apart, and vice 
versa. The KS percentile can be computed, analogous to the chisquare 
percentile. We reject samples in either tails, as in the case for the 
chisquare test. 
 
<a name="test-suite"></a> 
<H2>SPRNG Test Suite</H2>  
The SPRNG test suite implements the tests 
described by <A HREF="refs.html#knuth">Knuth</A>, and a few others. We 
have generalized the tests of single random number streams to detect 
correlations between streams in a parallel random number generator. In 
our test scheme we interleave several streams to form a new 
stream, and then test this new stream with conventional tests. We 
show an example in the figure below where we combine three streams to 
form a new stream. 
 
<P ALIGN=CENTER> 
<IMAGE BORDER=5 ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=491 HEIGHT=351 SRC="images/interleave.gif"> 
 
<P> 
We form several such new streams, and test several blocks of random 
numbers from each stream. Usually the result of the test for each 
block is a chisquare value. We take the chisquare statistics for all 
the blocks and use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify that they are 
distributed according to the chisquare distribution. If the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov percentile is between 1% and 99%, then the test is 
passed by the random number generator. 
 
<P> 
The tests in the SPRNG test suite take several arguments. The first 
few arguments are common to all the tests, and are explained below. The 
test specific arguments will be explained later. The SPRNG tests are 
called as follows: 
 
<P> 
<VAR>test.lib  nstreams ncombine seed param nblocks skip 
test_arguments</VAR> 
<P> 
where the name of the executable <VAR>test.lib</VAR> is formed by 
concatenating the name of the test and the random number library from 
which the random numbers are generated.  For example 
<P> 
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG> 
<P> 
<SAMP>equidist.lcg 4 2 0 0 3 1 2 100</SAMP><BR> 
<SAMP>mpirun -np 2 equidist.lcg 4 2 0 0 3 1 2 100</SAMP> 
<P> 
perform the equidistribution test with the <A 
HREF="generators.html#lcg48">48 bit Linear Congruential Generator with 
prime addend</A> in a serial and parallel machine respectively. 
<P> 
The argument <VAR>ncombine</VAR> ( = 2 in our example) indicates the 
number of streams we interleave to form a new stream. We form 
<VAR>nstreams</VAR> (=4) such new streams and test <VAR>nblocks</VAR> 
(=3) blocks of random numbers from each new stream. The argument 
<VAR>seed</VAR> (=0) is the encoded <A 
HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> to the random number 
generator, and <VAR>param</VAR> (=0) is the <A 
HREF="parameters.html">parameter</A> to the generator. The argument 
<VAR>skip</VAR> (=1) indicates how many random numbers we skip after 
testing a block before we start a test on the next block. The rest of 
the arguments in our example are specific to that test. Note that we 
can perform tests on individual streams by setting <VAR>ncombine</VAR> 
to 1. 
 
<P> 
The result of the example given above are as follows: 
<P> 
<SAMP> 
sprng/TESTS:sif% mpirun -np 2 equidist.lcg 4 2 0 0 3 1 2 100<BR> 
equidist.lcg  4  2  0  0  3  1  2  100 <BR>  
Result: KS value = 0.601752<BR> 
        KS value prob = 17.50 %<BR> 
</SAMP> 
<P> 
The <SAMP>KS value prob</SAMP> line gives the KS percentile for the 
entire set of tests. Since it is between 1% and 99%, we consider this 
example to have passed. It should be noted that the real tests are 
much larger than this simple example. 
 
<P> 
The figure below illustrates the use of random numbers in the 
example mentioned above.

<H3>Parallel versions of sequential tests</H3> 
While most of tests we have implemented are parallel versions of 
popular sequential tests, some others are inherently parallel. We 
first describe the former. The users should note that when we state 
that a particular test is parallel, we are refering to the fact that 
it can be used to test correlations between streams. We do not mean 
that it actually runs on multiple processors. All SPRNG tests run can 
be run either on a single processor or on multiple processors. 
<P> 
We next briefly describe each test followed by its test specific arguments. We 
also give the number of random numbers tested and asymptotic memory 
requirements (in bytes, assuming an integer is 4 bytes and double 
precision is 8 bytes). This should helps users estimate the time required for 
their calculations from smaller sample runs. 
 
<P> 
The details concerning these tests are presented in <A 
HREF="refs.html#knuth">Knuth's book</A>, unless we give some other reference.

<DT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=RED>1. Collisions test:</FONT> <SAMP>n logmd logd</SAMP> 
<DD>  Suppose we throw n << m balls into m urns, then most of the 
balls will fall into empty urns. If a ball falls into an urn that is 
occupied, then a collision is said to have occurred. The collisions test 
counts the number of collisions.  
 
<P> 
We generate random integers in [0,2<SUP>logd</SUP>-1]. We divide the 
sequence into n disjoint subsequences of length 2<SUP>logmd</SUP> 
each. We count the number of distinct sub-sequences obtained 
empirically and subtract this from n to obtain a count of the number 
of ``collisions''.  
 
<P> 
Our implementation of this test requires logmd*logd < 32. The number 
of subsequences, n, should also be less than the number of possible 
subsequences, 2<SUP>logmd*logd</SUP>.

<A NAME="coupon"></A> 
<DT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=RED>2. Coupon collector's test:</FONT> <SAMP> n t d </SAMP> 
 
<DD> We generate random integers in [0,d-1]. We then scan the sequence 
until we find at least one instance of each of the d integers, and 
note the length of the segment over which we found this complete 
set. For example, if d = 3 and the sequence is: 0 2 0 1 ..., then the 
length of the first segment over which we found a complete set of 
integers is 4. We continue from the next position in the sequence 
until we find n such complete sets. The distribution of lengths of the 
segments is compared against the expected distribution. In our 
analysis, we lump segments of length > t together.<P>

<DD>  
 We generate floating point numbers in (0,1) and note the gap in 
the sequence between successive appearances of numbers in the interval 
[a,b] in (0,1). For example, if [a,b] = 
[0.4,0.7] and the sequence is: 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.6, ..., then the 
length of the first gap (between the numbers 0.5 and 0.6) is 2. We record 'n' 
  such gaps, and lump gap lengths greater than 't' together in a category 
  in our analysis.<P>

We generate m floating point numbers in (0,1). We can rank them 
according to their magnitude; the smallest number 
is ranked 1, ..., the largest is ranked m. There are m! possible ways 
in which the ranks can be ordered. For example, if m = 3, then the 
following orders are possible:  
(1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1).

We generate k integers in [0,d-1] and count the number of distinct

0, 1, 1, ..., then the number of distinct integers obtained in the

 We count the length of a "run" in which successive random numbers

0.3, then the length of the first run is 3. We repeat this n times and compare with the expected 
distribution of run lengths for random samples from the uniform 
distribution. Runs of length greater than 't' are lumped together 
during our analysis. We implement a modified version of this test in 
which we discard the number that follows a run before starting the new

<A NAME="parallel-tests"></A>  
<H3>Inherently parallel tests</H3> 
Unlike the preceding tests which modify sequential tests to test for 
correlations between streams, the tests mentioned below are inherently 
parallel and test for correlations between streams. The meaning of the 
arguments for these tests are slightly different from those 
for the preceding tests. Since these tests are inherently parallel, we 
need not interleave streams, and thus the second argument 
<VAR>ncombine</VAR> should be set to 1. The first argument 
<VAR>nstreams</VAR> is the total number of streams tested. All these 
streams are tested simulatnaneously, rather than independently as in 
the previous case. The rest of the arguments are indentical to the 
previous case. 
 
<P> 
<DL> 
<A NAME="sum"></A> 
<DT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=RED>1. Sum of independent distributions test:</FONT><SAMP> n 
groupsize</SAMP>  
<P> 
<DD>We can use the fact that the sum of independent variables approaches 
the normal distribution to test for the independence of random number 
streams. We add random numbers from several streams and form a sum. We 
generate several such sums and check if their distribution is 
normal.  
 
<P> 
We add <SAMP>groupsize</SAMP> random numbers in (0,1) 
from each stream to form a sum. We verify if the distribution of 
<SAMP>n</SAMP> such sums is normal using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test. We illustrate this test in the figure below with 
<VAR>nstreams</VAR> = 3, <VAR>n</VAR> = 4, and <VAR>groupsize</VAR> = 
2. 
<P ALIGN=CENTER>  
<IMAGE BORDER=5 ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=486 HEIGHT=376 SRC="images/sum.gif">  
 
<P> 
In the current implementation, the argument <VAR>nblocks</VAR> must be 
1, implying that only one test is performed. The reason for this is 
that the result of this test is not exact. The true distribution 
approaches the normal distribution, but is not identical to it. Thus 
the result of this test has an error, and we are not sure if 
subjecting a number of such results to another test would yield 
meaningful results. 
 
<P> 
We have numerically calculated the maximum difference between the 
exact distribution and the normal distribution. Based on this result, 
we also output a range for the the exact KS statistic, if we had used the 
true distribution instead of the normal approximation.

<H2>Adding New Tests</H2> We have provided utilities for others to 
implement their own tests in C if they are along the pattern of the 
tests in which we interleave streams and subject them to tests of 
sequential random number streams. A library called 
<SAMP>libsprngtest.a</SAMP> is created when a user build the TESTS

<HR> 
The file tests.h declares the functions available in libsprngtest.a. A 
few global variables are also declared. The global variables are: 
proc_rank and NTESTS. The former is the rank of the process in the MPI 
version. In a sequential version the value of this variable is 
0. NTESTS is equal to the product of <VAR>nstreams</VAR> and 
<VAR>nblocks</VAR> and is thus the total number of subsequences 
tested. 
 
<P> 
We first call the function init_tests. This function calls MPI_Init in 
the MPI version of the program and finds the process rank and the 
total number of processes. It then performs certain 
initializations. For example, we need to interleave streams and create 
<VAR>nstreams</VAR> new streams. This function distributes the task of 
testing these new streams among the available processes. It returns 
the number of blocks to be tested by the local process. A test on each 
block will return a chisquare value. We store these chisquare values 
in an array called V. Note that we have defined this array to have as 
many entries as the number of tests conducted over all the processes, 
rather than the number of tests conducted in the local process. This 
simplifies the programming a little, and is usually not much of an 
overhead. 
<P> 
We call the function that actually performs the test on each process 
<SAMP>ntests</SAMP> times and store the chisquare values returned. We 
next call the function getKSdata, which collects the chisquare values 
on each process and places them in the array V on process 0. This 
function also calls MPI_Finalize. 
<P> 
Process 0 next performs the Komogorov-Smirnov test. It needs to 
determine if the chisquare values returned could have come from the 
chisquare distribution. The degrees of freedom for our test is 1, and 
we set this through the function set_d_of_f. Next the function KS is 
called which performs the Komogorov-Smirnov test. This function needs 
the cumulative distribution function of the distribution to compare 
against. <SAMP>chiF</SAMP> is a function that returns the cumulative 
distribution function of the chisquare distribution with the degrees 
of freedom set by the call to set_d_of_f. Finally, KS percent is 
called to determine the percentile of the statistic from the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
<P> 
The actaul test mentioned here tests whether half the numbers are 
greater than 0.5. The important aspects here are the call to get_rn to 
get the next random number, and the call to chisquare to get the 
chisquare statistic. 
<P> 
Users will usually mainly change the function mytest. Most of the 
other parts of the program should be identical in all the programs. 
<P>

<H2>Testing New Random Number Generators</H2> 
 
We can easily test new random number generators. Let us assume that 
the new generator is in the library libnew.a, in the same directory as 
the other SPRNG libraries.  
 
<UL> 
<LI>This new generator must define functions 
called <SAMP>init_rng</SAMP>, <SAMP>get_rn_dbl</SAMP>, and <SAMP>free_rng</SAMP> that follow the specifications of the 
SPRNG functions <A HREF="default-interface.html#initsprng">init_sprng</A>, 
<A HREF="default-interface.html#sprng">sprng</A>, and  <A 
HREF="default-interface.html#freesprng">free_sprng</A> respectively (that is, the 
first function must perform an initialization, the second must produce 
random double precision numbers, and the third must free up any memory 
allocated for the random stream). 
 
<P> 
If users wish to test only a single random number stream, then they 
can, instead of defining the above functions, just write the stream of 
random double precision numbers to a file in ASCII (not in binary 
format). Then they should define the macro <SAMP>READ_FROM_STDIN</SAMP> 
in the file <SAMP>sprng/TESTS/init_tests.c</SAMP> and compile. The 
test programs will then read input from standard input. If users 
redirect stdin from the random number file, then these numbers will be 
tested. This procedure will not, however, work for the Ising model 
programs (Wolff and Metropolis.) 
<P> 
 
<LI>The user just needs to add <VAR>new</VAR> to the list specified by 
<SAMP>LIBLIST</SAMP> in the Makefile in the TESTS directory and 
compile.  
<P> 
<STRONG>Example:</STRONG> <SAMP>LIBLIST = lcg lfg 
</SAMP><VAR>new</VAR> 
</UL> 
Exectuables are created with the name 
<VAR>test</VAR>.</VAR>new</VAR> for each test <VAR>test</VAR>. For 
example <SAMP>equidist</SAMP>.<VAR>new</VAR> is the equidistribution 
test executable for the new generator.
