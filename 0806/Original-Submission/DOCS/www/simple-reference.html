<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Simple Interface</H1> 
<P> 
In this section, we give detailed descriptions of each SPRNG 
function call with the simple interface.  It is invoked by <A 
HREF="macros.html">defining</A> the <A 
HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> 
<SAMP>SIMPLE_SPRNG</SAMP> before <A 
HREF="definitions.html#include"><EM>including</EM></A> a SPRNG <A 
HREF="definitions.html#header"><EM>header file</EM></A>. This interface is used 
when only one random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A> is required on each process at 
any given time. In this case, it is not necessary to use stream <A 
HREF="definitions.html#ID"><EM>ID</EM></A>  to distinguish between different 
streams. Hence a simpler interface is possible in which SPRNG maintains a 
single random number stream. Functions that require a stream ID in other 
interfaces make use of this stream instead. 
<P> 
 
<H2>Pointers for FORTRAN users</H2> 
Different random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> available on a 
process, in other interfaces, are distinguished by unique <A 
HREF="definitions.html#ID"><EM>ID's</EM></A>, which are implemented as pointers 
to memory locations where <A 
HREF="definitions.html#state"><EM>states</EM></A> of the 
respective streams are stored. Though stream ID's are not used in the 
simple interface, some functions return pointers for the sake 
of consistency with the other interfaces. Since standard FORTRAN 77 does not have 
a pointer 
type, we can store a pointer as an integer of the same size as a C 
pointer.  We have defined a <A 
HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> called  <A 
HREF="macros.html"><SAMP>POINTER</SAMP></A> in the file <A 
HREF="sprng.html#sprngf"><SAMP>sprng_f.h</SAMP></A> that 
automatically defines an integer of the correct size on  
platforms on which SPRNG is supported. A FORTRAN programmer can then 
use the type <SAMP>POINTER</SAMP> just as if it were a FORTRAN data 
type. However, this applies only if the FORTRAN program is <A HREF="languages.html#fortran">compiled</A> with the same flags as given in the <A 
HREF="makefile.html">make file</A> that comes with SPRNG. 
<P> 
 
<H2>Terminology</H2> 
In the following description, an argument marked as IN indicates that 
the argument, or array elements pointed to by that argument, are 
read by the function, but not modified. OUT indicates that the 
argument, or array elements pointed to by that argument, are written 
into by the function, but that its values are not used by the 
function. Arguments that are both read and modified are denoted by INOUT. 
 
 
<H2> SPRNG Functions</H2> 
We describe below SPRNG function calls available in the simple 
interface. For each function, the C call is given first, followed by the FORTRAN 
call. The data type preceding the function name is the type 
returned by the function. The data types preceding the arguments to the 
functions are the data types of the corresponding function arguments.

<SAMP>IN seed, IN param</SAMP>.<BR> 
<BR> 
<DD> <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP> initializes random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A>.  This function 
call can be omitted if the user wishes to use default values of 
the arguments.<BR> 
<BR> 
<SAMP>seed</SAMP> is the 
     <A HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> to the random 
     number generator. It is not the starting <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#state"><EM>state</EM></A> of the 
     sequence; rather, it is an encoding of the starting state. It 
     is acceptable (and recommended) to use the 
     same seed for all the streams. Distinct streams are returned 
     based on their seed and the stream number.  Only the 31 least significant 
     bits of <SAMP>seed</SAMP> are used in determining the initial 
     starting state of the stream. Higher order bits 
     that are set will be ignored. No warning message is printed if 
     the higher order bits are set.<BR> 
<BR> 
The argument <A 
     HREF="parameters.html"><SAMP>param</SAMP></A> selects  
     appropriate parameters (for example, multiplier for a Linear 
     Congruential Generator or lag for a Lagged Fibonacci 
     Generator).  The <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> 
     <SAMP>SPRNG_DEFAULT</SAMP>, <A HREF="macros.html">defined</A>  in  
     SPRNG <A HREF="definitions.html#header"><EM>header files</EM></A>, can be used to choose  
     default parameters. If an invalid parameter is passed to this function, 
     then a warning message is sent to <SAMP>stderr</SAMP> and the default 
     parameter is used.<BR> 
<BR> 
<SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP> 
     returns a <A HREF="definitions.html#null"><EM>NULL</EM></A> 
     pointer if it fails, normally due to an inability to allocate 
     memory. Otherwise it returns a non-<SAMP>NULL</SAMP> value. <BR> 
<BR> 
 If 
     the <a href="message-passing.html#mpi">MPI</a> version of SPRNG 
     has been installed and the macro 
     <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP> has been defined 
     before <A HREF="definitions.html#include">including</A> a SPRNG header file, then this routine makes some MPI calls to 
     determine the number of processes. This value is used to ensure 
     that different streams are produced on different processes. If 
     the MPI version of SPRNG has been installed but the macro 
     <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP> has not been defined, then the same stream 
     is returned on all processes (provided the same 
     <SAMP>seed</SAMP> and <SAMP>param</SAMP> value have been passed 
     to this function on all processes). If the MPI version of 
     SPRNG has not been installed but the macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP> 
     has been defined, then a warning message is sent to 
     <SAMP>stderr</SAMP> and the initialization is performed as if the 
     macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP> has not been defined. 
<P> 
In case the user calls <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP> while another stream  
has already been initialized by calling <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>unpack_sprng</SAMP>, <SAMP>isprng</SAMP> or <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>, 
then the new stream replaces the previous one. If a call to this 
function fails, then the previous stream is still available.<BR> 
<BR> 
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If the user has installed the MPI version of the library and 
defined the macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP>, then the user must have called 
<SAMP>MPI_Init</SAMP> before making calls to 
<SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP>. The user should also call 
<SAMP>MPI_Finalize</SAMP> later. SPRNG does not make either of these 
calls.<BR>

If  FORTRAN programmers

     <SAMP>float</SAMP> numbers, instead of the double precision

If no stream has been initialized before,  by calling <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>unpack_sprng</SAMP>, <SAMP>isprng</SAMP> or <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>, 
then a new stream is initialized using the default parameters. If this 
initialization fails due to an inability to allocate sufficient

Calling

<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A>.  This 
is typically  done when the user wishes to record information which can

<DD> This function produces a new <A 
HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A>  using system date and time 
information. It will typically be used when the programmer wishes to 
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialize</EM></A>  with a
different seed every time the program is run.   User should note that
both the Lagged Fibonacci 
     Generators requires the use of the same seed for each stream in 
     order to guarantee their <A HREF="definitions.html#independence"><EM>independence</EM></A>. In order to ensure 
     this on a parallel computer, they should install the <A 
     HREF="message-passing.html#mpi">MPI</A> version of SPRNG  
     and <A HREF="macros.html">define</A> the <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> 
     <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP> before <A

     involves some inter-processor 
     communication. <BR> 
<BR> 
If the user has installed the MPI version of the library but has not 
defined the macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP>, then the seed could be different 
on the different processes. No warning message is printed. If the 
user has not installed the MPI version of the library but includes the 
macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP>, then link time errors will be reported by 
the compiler.<BR> 
<BR> 
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If users have installed the MPI version of the library and 
defined the macro <SAMP>USE_MPI</SAMP>, then they must call 
<SAMP>MPI_Init</SAMP> before making calls to 
<SAMP>make_sprng_seed</SAMP>. The user should also call 
<SAMP>MPI_Finalize</SAMP> later. SPRNG does not make either of these 
calls. If any process calls <SAMP>make_sprng_seed</SAMP>, then users 
should ensure that all their processes call this function, since 
collective MPI operations are performed here.<BR>

<DD> This function packs the <A 
HREF="definitions.html#state"><EM>state</EM></A> of the random number <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A>  into an array and 
returns the number of bytes actually required for the storage.  <BR> 
<BR> 
<SAMP>fbuffer</SAMP> should be  the first element of an array of size <SAMP>MAX_PACKED_LENGTH</SAMP> 
bytes, where <SAMP>MAX_PACKED_LENGTH</SAMP> is a <A 
HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> <A 
HREF="macros.html">defined</A>  in <SAMP>"sprng_f.h"</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>"sprng.h"</SAMP>.  If the memory in the array is insufficient, 
undetected errors could occur. It might also lead to segmentation 
faults. In the C interface, the programmer need not 
allocate memory. SPRNG allocates memory for the 
array and has the result stored in <SAMP>*buffer</SAMP>.  
<BR> 
<BR> 
 Calls to this 
function in C or FORTRAN involve memory allocation within this 
function. In case of insufficient memory, an error message is sent to 
<SAMP>stderr</SAMP> and the value 0 is returned. 
<BR> 
<BR> 
This function can be used for <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#checkpoint"><EM>check-pointing</EM></A>, where the programmer 
     packs the state of the stream into an array and then saves it 
     to a file. This state can later be retrieved by calling 
     <SAMP>unpack_sprng</SAMP>, which is explained below. <SAMP>pack_sprng</SAMP> can also be 
     used to pass a stream to another process. That process will 
     unpack the packed array to obtain the stream. <BR>

<DD> This function recreates a <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A> given the array 
     <SAMP>buffer</SAMP> or <SAMP>fbuffer</SAMP>, which was used to store the stream's <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#state"><EM>state</EM></A>      through a call to the function <SAMP>pack_sprng</SAMP>.  The return value 
     should be ignored unless it is <A 
     HREF="definitions.html#null"><EM>NULL</EM></A>. A 
     <SAMP>NULL</SAMP> pointer is returned only if this function 
     failed due to an inability to allocate memory.<BR> 
<BR> 
 Calls to this function involve memory allocation. In 
     case sufficient memory was not obtained, an error message is 
     sent to <A HREF="definitions.html#stderr"><EM>stderr</EM></A>  and the <SAMP>NULL</SAMP></A>  pointer is 
     returned. The packed string must be the state of a valid 
     stream. If it is not, the error may not necessarily be 
     detected by SPRNG. If an error is detected, then an error message 
     is sent to <SAMP>stderr</SAMP> and a <SAMP>NULL</SAMP> pointer is 
     returned.<BR> 
<BR> 
<P> 
In case a random number stream has already been initialized,  by calling <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>unpack_sprng</SAMP>, <SAMP>isprng</SAMP> or <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>, 
then the 
unpacked stream replaces the previous stream. If a call to this 
function fails, then the previous stream is still available.<BR>
