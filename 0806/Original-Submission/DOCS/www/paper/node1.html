<P> 
Random numbers arise in computer applications in several different 
contexts, such as :  
(i)&nbsp;In the Monte 
Carlo method to estimate a many-dimensional integral by sampling the 
integrand.  Metropolis Monte 
Carlo  or, more generally, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to which this volume is mainly devoted, is a sophisticated 
version of this where one uses properties of random walks to solve 
problems in high dimensional spaces, particularly those arising in statistical 
mechanics,  
(ii)&nbsp;In modeling random processes in 
nature such as those arising in ecology or economics.  
(iii)&nbsp;In cryptography, one uses 
randomness to hide information from others.  
(iv)&nbsp;Random numbers may 
also be used in games, for example during interaction 
with the user. 
<P> 
It is only the first class of applications to which this article is 
devoted, because these computations require the highest quality of 
random numbers. The ability to do a multidimensional integral relies 
on properties of uniformity of n-tuples of random numbers and/or the 
equivalent property that random numbers be uncorrelated. 
The quality aspect in the other uses is normally less important 
simply because the models are usually not all that precisely specified. The largest 
uncertainties are typically due more to approximations arising in the formulation of 
the model than those caused by lack of randomness in the random 
number generator. 
<P> 
In contrast, the first class of applications can require very precise 
solutions. Increasingly, computers are being used to solve very 
well-defined  but hard mathematical problems. For example, as 
Dirac&nbsp;[<A HREF="node19.html#dirac">1</A>] observed in 1929, the physical laws necessary for 
the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of 
chemistry are completely known and it is only necessary to find 
precise methods for solving the equations for complex systems. In the 
intervening years fast computers and new computational methods have 
come into existence.  In quantum chemistry, physical properties must 
be calculated to ``chemical accuracy'' (say 0.001 Rydbergs) to be 
relevant to physical properties.  This often requires a relative 
accuracy of <IMG WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1329" SRC="img1.gif"> or better.  Monte Carlo methods are used to 
solve the ``electronic structure problem'' often to high levels of 
accuracy&nbsp;[<A HREF="node19.html#andersonjb">2</A>] (see also articles by Reynolds, 
Nightingale, and Kalos in this volume). In these methods one can use 
from <IMG WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1331" SRC="img2.gif"> to <IMG WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1333" SRC="img3.gif"> random numbers, and subtle correlations 
between these numbers could lead to significant errors. 
<P> 
Another example is from the numerical study of phase 
transitions. Renormalization theory has proven accurate for the basic 
scaling properties of simple transitions. The attention of the 
research community is now shifting to corrections to scaling, and to 
more complex models.  Very long simulations (also of the MCMC type) 
are done to investigate this effect and it has been discovered that 
the random number generator can influence the 
results&nbsp;[<A HREF="node19.html#ferrenberg">3</A>, <A HREF="node19.html#grassberger">4</A>, <A HREF="node19.html#selke">5</A>, <A HREF="node19.html#schmid">6</A>]. As computers 
become more powerful, and Monte Carlo methods become more commonly 
used and more central to scientific progress, the quality of the 
random number sequence becomes more important. 
<P> 
Given that the quality (which we shall define in a moment) of random 
 numbers is becoming more and more important, the unfortunate fact is 
 that important aspects of quality are very difficult to prove 
 mathematically. The best one can do today is test empirically.  
But an empirical test is always 
 finite. We will report here tests on random number streams that are of record 
 length (up to about <IMG WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1333" SRC="img3.gif"> numbers). However, they will have to be redone 
 in a few years with even longer sequences. Also, important 
 algorithms use random numbers in a way that is hard to encapsulate in 
 a test for which we know the answer, and so we must resort to general 
 guidelines on safe ways to use random number generators in practice. 
<P> 
This article constitutes a brief review of recent developments 
in random number generation. There are several excellent reviews of 
the older literature. In particular we recommend the reader seriously 
interested in random number generation read the lengthy introduction 
in Knuth&nbsp;[<A HREF="node19.html#knuth">7</A>] and the shorter introduction in the 2nd edition 
of Numerical Recipes&nbsp;[<A HREF="node19.html#numericalrecipes">8</A>]. More information can 
also be found in references&nbsp;[<A HREF="node19.html#park">9</A>, <A HREF="node19.html#L'E">10</A>, <A HREF="node19.html#marsaglia3">11</A>]. 
<P> 
We shall focus here on developments caused by widespread use of 
parallel computers to perform Monte Carlo calculations. Our impression 
is that individual users are porting random number generators to 
parallel computers in an ad hoc fashion, possibly unaware of some of 
the issues which come to the fore when massive calculations are 
performed.  Parallel algorithms can probe other qualities of random 
number generators such as inter-process correlation.  There is a 
recent review which covers parallel random number generation in 
somewhat more depth by Coddington&nbsp;[<A HREF="node19.html#coddington3">12</A>].  The interested 
reader can also refer 
to&nbsp;[<A HREF="node19.html#MCPR1">13</A>, <A HREF="node19.html#percuskalos">14</A>, <A HREF="node19.html#brent">15</A>, <A HREF="node19.html#mascagni">16</A>, <A HREF="node19.html#CMPTEST">17</A>] for work 
related to parallel random number generation and testing. 
<P> 
This article is structured as follows. First we discuss the 
desired properties that random number generators should have. Next we 
discuss several methods that have been used as generators in 
particular on parallel computers.  Then we discuss testing procedures 
and show some results of our extensive tests.  Quasi random numbers 
(QRN) have recently been introduced as a way to achieve faster 
convergence than true random numbers. We briefly discuss these 
 and give some guidelines concerning those applications for which they are 
likely to be most effective. 
<P> 
We have recently developed a library implementing several of the 
parallel random number generators and statistical tests of them on the 
most widely available multiprocessor computers. Documentation and 
software are available at:<BR> <B>
