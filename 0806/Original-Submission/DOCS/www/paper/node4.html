 In the early days of computers, 
it was suggested that one could make a special circuit element which 
would deliver truly random numbers. Computer vendors have not supplied 
such an element because it is not trivial to design a device to 
deliver high quality numbers at a sufficient rate.  Even more 
importantly, debugging codes would becomes much more difficult if each 
time the code was run a completely irreproducible sequence were to be 
generated. 
In Monte Carlo simulations, 
bugs may be manifest only at certain times, depending on the sequence 
of random numbers obtained. In order to detect the errors, it is 
necessary to repeat the calculations to find out how the errors 
occurred.  The feature of reproducibility is also helpful while 
porting the program to a different machine.  If we have a sample run 
from one machine available, then we can try an identical run on a 
different machine and verify that it ported correctly. 
Such reproducible random number generators are said to 
be <I>pseudo random</I> (PRNG), and we shall call the numbers produced 
by such generators as <I>PRN</I>s. 
<P> 
There is a conflict between the requirements of reproducibility and 
randomness. On a finite memory computer, at any step <I>k</I> in the sequence 
the PRNG has an internal <I>state</I> specifiable conceptually by an 
integer <IMG WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1395" SRC="img15.gif">, where the size of this integer is not necessarily 
related to the word length of the computer. For each state <I>S</I> in the 
sequence, there is a mapping that gives a random number the user sees, 
<IMG WIDTH=86 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1399" SRC="img16.gif">. We also have an iteration process to determine the 
next state of the sequence from the current state, <IMG WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1401" SRC="img17.gif">. 
All PRNGs can be 
classified by the internal state space, the mapping, and the 
iteration.  
The sequence is defined once we have specified the initial 
starting state <IMG WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1403" SRC="img18.gif"> known as the <I>seed</I>.

pseudo-random sequences described above.

Now let us return to the possible conflict 
between the properties of reproducibility and randomness: if it is 
reproducible then it cannot be perfectly random since knowing the 
sequence will make betting on the next number easy.  How do we resolve 
the incompatibility between the two properties?  In common sense 
terms, we mean a good PRNG is one whose numbers are uncorrelated 
as long as you do not explicitly try to back out the 
mapping and iteration processes and use that to predict another member 
of the sequence. PRNG's have not been designed to be good 
cryptographic sequences.
