IMPORTANT: Please read CHANGES.TEXT for the history of changes since
the last release of SPRNG.
 
The SPRNG libraries of generators produce good quality random numbers,
and are also fast. They have been subjected to some of the largest
random number tests, with around 10^13 RNs per test.

Languages: C, C++, FORTRAN

Platforms: Cray T3E, IBM SP2, SGI Power Challenge Array, Origin 2000,
           CONVEX Exemplar, SUN workstations, PC running Linux, HP
           workstations

Generators: Modified Additive Lagged Fibonacci, Multiplicative Lagged
            Fibonacci, Combined Multiple Recursive generator, three types of
            Linear Congruential. 

(The user can switch from one generator to another at link time,
without modifying or recompiling the code.)

Directory structure:

  SRC:      SPRNG source code.

  EXAMPLES: Example program that demonstrate the use of the SPRNG.

  TESTS:    Test suite to verify the quality of sequential and parallel
            random number generators.

  DOCS:     Detailed documentation. For more up-to-date information:
               http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Apps/SPRNG/www/toc.html

  include:  Header files for the user to include.

  lib: The SPRNG libraries will go in here when SPRNG is built.

Building the library:

To build the library, examples and tests, please edit the make.CHOICES
file to select the type of platform you are working on. Then type:
     make 

To build the library alone, please type:
     make SRC

In case of errors, please edit the SRC/make.XXX file for your platform.

After the make is completed, please type:
     checksprng

This checks each generator to verify that the library works as expected.

Please see documentation for details.
