<p>When you pressed the &quot;Edit&quot; button in the browser window, you asked
to be taken to the source code for the object you were looking at.&nbsp; The web
page knows the <i>relative</i> path to the source code for the object - relative
to the root of the project tree.&nbsp; What you are being asked to supply in
this dialog is the path to the root of the project tree.</p>
<p>After you supply this directory, it will be stored away so that the next time
you press &quot;Edit&quot; in the documentation for this project, you will not
be bothered with this dialog.</p>
