** Blitz-0.10

Released June 27, 2012

This is an AS-IS snapshot release of the current state of the blitz mercurial 
source code development repository. Besides numerous bug fixes since the 
Blitz-0.9 release back in 2005, development work has been done in an effort
to improve performance, 64-bit compatibility, and thread safety, and to take
advantage of SIMD instructions by utilizing careful data alignment. Most of 
these upgrades are not well documented as of yet, and are only apparent via
some new configure script options.
