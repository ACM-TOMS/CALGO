Things it might be nice to do someday.


* Soon

** make Blitz STL-compliant

** extend "new" expression template support to all blitz container classes,
not just Arrays

** expression template support for TinyMatrix (or perhaps a merger with the
tvmet library)

** proper usage of std namespace within blitz (reduce or eliminate use of
non-standard headers and using directives)

** add RPM as a dist medium

* Later

** make Blitz OpenMP supported
