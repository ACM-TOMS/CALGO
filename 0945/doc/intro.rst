Welcome to the modred project!

This is an easy-to-use and parallelized library for finding modal
decompositions and reduced-order models.

Parallel implementations of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD),
balanced POD (BPOD), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and Petrov-Galerkin
projection are provided, 
as well as serial implementations of the Observer Kalman filter Identification
method (OKID) and the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA).
Modred is applicable to a wide range of problems and nearly
any type of data.

For smaller and simpler datasets, there is a Matlab-like interface.
For larger and more complicated datasets, you can provide modred classes with
functions to interact with your data.

This work was supported by a grant from the the National Science Foundation.
