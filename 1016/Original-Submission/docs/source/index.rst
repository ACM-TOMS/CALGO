The MGRIT algorithm is a reduction-based time-multigrid method for solving time-dependent problems. In contrast to
solving sequentially for one time step after the other, the MGRIT algorithm is an iterative method that allows
calculating multiple time steps simultaneously by using a time-grid hierarchy. The MGRIT method is a non-intrusive
approach that essentially uses the same time integrator as a traditional time-stepping algorithm. Therefore, it is
particularly well suited for introducing time parallelism in simulations using existing application codes.
