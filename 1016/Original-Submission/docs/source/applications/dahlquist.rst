The simplest scalar ODE, made famous by Germund Dahlquist, is given by

.. math::
    u' = \lambda u \;\;\text{ in } (t_0, t_{end}]\;\; \text{ with }\; u(t_0) = 1,

and constant :math:`\lambda < 0`.
The exact solution :math:`u(t) = e^{\lambda(t-t_0)}u(t_0)` decays to zero as time increases.

For :math:`t_0 = 0, t_{end} = 5,` and :math:`\lambda = -1`, for example, we obtain the following solution:
