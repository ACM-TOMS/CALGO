This directory contains the files required to rebuild theuserManual should that be necessary.

Note: The acmtrans2e.cls file is a hacked version of an old ACM Transactions style file. This version is necessary because of fatal interactions of the original file with the packages required to build the manual.

I changed the documentstyle to ./acmtrans2e and this has worked -- I don't claim this will be a universal fix as it was ok when the author ran it.

Use pdflatex.
