This is the README file for the code submitted along with the paper entitled

	"A Flexible Implementation of Matching Pursuit for Gabor Functions on the Interval"

which has been submitted to TOMS.  This code is submitted on Feb. 12, 2001, and re-submitted
Nov. 26 2001.


All enquires to Larry Kolasa   lkolasa@acs.ryerson.ca

To run the test and demo programs do the following.

1) Change directories to TOMS_MP, if you are not already there.

2) Type "make" at the prompt.  This will compile all of the code and generate the
   two executables, "MPTest" and "MPDemo".

3) Type "./MPTest" to run the test program.  This will run the algorithm and test it against
   the test data which is in the file called "input_test.data".  As each test is passed the user will be
   prompted to continue the tests.  If a test fails, the program exits.

4) Type "./MPDemo m", where m is a positive integer and 2^m is the number of sample data points in the
input signal.  This is the Demo program.  The purpose of the demo program is to give an idea of how
to utilize the functions for performing the MP algorithm.  The comments should give an idea how to
employ the code.


Originally the MPTest driver had the facility to read data from a file ac1
although this wasn't activated in the finally submitted code. It didn't
seem to work either so it's been removed.

In addition the MPTest now attempts to run all the tests without prompting.
