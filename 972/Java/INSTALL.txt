Installation Instructions:

Required packages:

The jMarkov library needs some third party libraries for
all its features to work properly. All the libraries listed here
are open source, but keep in mind that not all of them are released
under the Eclipse license, as it is jMarkov. We recommend to verify
that the conditions of the third party libraries licenses listed 
here fit the requirements of your project.

1. COLT: http://acs.lbl.gov/ACSSoftware/colt/
2. JAMA: http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/
3. JCOMMON: http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/
4. JFREECHART: http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/
5. MTJ 1.0: http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.matrix-toolkits-java/mtj/1.0

I. Installing the jMarkov.jar library: 

Working with an Eclipse project:
Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
written in Java. It provides an integrated compiler and a debugger.
These are some simple steps to start using jMarkov with Eclipse:

1. Create a new Java project in eclipse: File->New->Java Project.

2. Copy the file jMarkov.jar somewhere in your file system. In this case
we assume that the jar file is placed in a folder named "lib" inside the
folder of the project created in the previous step.

3. Copy the jar files of the third parties required by jMarkov in the same
"lib" folder.

4. Add the jar files to the build path of the project: 
Project->Properties->Java Build Path->Libraries. Select Add JARs and in the
context window that will open, select all the jar files in the folder "lib" that 
were copied in the two previous steps.

5. Create a jMarkov model. For the illustration of this first setup we may 
use one of the examples provided at the jMarkov project. For the purpose of 
these instruction we use the example Jackson.java. Hence, copy the file 
Jackson.java and the folder JacksonFiles, which you can find in src/examples/jmarkov, 
with its contents to the "src" folder of your project.

6. Now you are ready for a test drive. Right click in the file Jackson.java and
then Run as->Java application. If everything goes well, the graphical interface of 
jMarkov should open with the results for this example. Enjoy!

 

 
 
II. Installing the jMarkov source code: 

Working with an Eclipse project:
Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
written in Java. It provides an integrated compiler and a debugger.
These are some simple steps to start using the jMarkov source code with Eclipse:

1. Create a new Java project in eclipse: File->New->Java Project.

2. Create a "src" folder within your project to hold all the source code. 

3. Copy the contents of the "JMarkov/src" folder into the "src" folder of your project. 

4. Create a folder named "lib" into your project to hold the third party libraries. 
Copy the jar files of the third parties required by jMarkov in the "lib" folder.

4. Add the jar files to the build path of the project: 
Project->Properties->Java Build Path->Libraries. Select Add JARs and in the
context window that will open, select all the jar files in the folder "lib" that 
were copied in the previous step.

5. The jMarkov source code is ready to use. For illustration look at the classes 
in the folder "src/examples" to see and run classes that use the jMarkov classes. 
with its contents to the "src" folder of your project. 
For instance, look into the "src/examples/jmarkov" folder for the Jackson.java. 
Right click and Run as->Java application. If everything goes well, the graphical interface of 
jMarkov should open with the results for this example. Enjoy!
