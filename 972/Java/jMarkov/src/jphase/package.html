This package provides capabilities for modeling Phase type distributions. 
Phase type distributions are a very general family of destribution,
which can be shown to be dense. That means that any distribution for 
a positive random variable can be approximated with a Phase type 
distribution. Phase type distributions are also useful because 
of numerous closeure properties.
