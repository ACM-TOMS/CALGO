jMarkov

Description: 
jMarkov is a Java framework for Markov-chain (MC) modelling that provides the user with the ability to define MCs from
the basic rules that determine their dynamics. From these rules, jMarkov explores and builds the state space and the
other MC parameters, which are then used to solve the MC and determine user-defined steady-state and transient performance
measures. 

jMarkov is composed of four modules: 
The jMarkov module: for finite finite MCs. 
The jQBD module: for Quasi-Birth-and-Death MCs. 
The jPhase module: for Phase-type random variables. 
The jMDP module: for Markov Decision Processes. 

Required packages:

The jMarkov library needs some third party libraries for
all its features to work properly. All the libraries listed here
are open source, but keep in mind that not all of them are released
under the Eclipse license, as it is jMarkov. We recommend to verify
that the conditions of the third party libraries licenses listed 
here fit the requirements of your project.
