% For the software to run successfully, the script-file
% gohome.m must be edited to reflect the correct path
% sequence on the installed computer.  
%
% The default implementation is for a Unix architecture. 
% To install the IFISS software on a Windows PC, set gohome.m
% and then run the script-file: install_pc.m
% Subsequently to run the software you need to execute the 
% script-file: setpath as soon as you start matlab.
% To move a PC version of IFISS to a Unix architecture, set
% gohome.m and then run the script-file: install_unix.m
