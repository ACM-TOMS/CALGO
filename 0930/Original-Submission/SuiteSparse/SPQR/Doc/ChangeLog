Jun 20, 2012: verison 1.3.1

    * minor update for Windows (removed filesep)

Jun 1, 2012: version 1.3.0

    * changed from UFconfig to SuiteSparse_config
    * removed -DTIMING option.  Timing is now enabled by default.
    * added SuiteSparse_tic, SuiteSparse_toc, SuiteSparse_time timing functions
    * spqr_time removed (use SuiteSparse_time instead)

Dec 7, 2011: version 1.2.3

    * fixed the Makefile to better align with CFLAGS and other standards
    * minor fix to SPQR/MATLAB/spqr_make.m
    * Makefile now detects whether or not METIS is present, and
        sets -DNPARTITION if it is not

May 10, 2011: version 1.2.2

    * minor fix to SPQR/Include/SuiteSparseQR_C.h to accomodate the mixing
        of C/C++ with a particular compiler  

Jan 25, 2011: version 1.2.1

    * minor fix to "make install"
    * added more examples to SPRQ/Demo/qrdemo.cpp
    * fixed error-condition return value for Source/SuiteSparseQR.cpp
    * minor fix to SPQR/Tcov/qrtest.cpp

Nov 30, 2009: version 1.2.0

    * fixed interface to 64-bit BLAS for MATLAB 7.8
    * added "make install" and "make uninstall"
    * added info struct output to spqr mexFunction
    * added 2-norm of w statistic
    * changed default ordering back to always use COLAMD.  Default in v1.1.2
        and v1.1.1 was to use COLAMD if m < 2*n and use AMD(A'A)
        or METIS(A'A) otherwise.

May 1, 2009, version 1.1.2

    * added more examples to user guide and to spqr.m
    * removed "static" declaration of functions in Source/* files.  This
	corrects a problem with the Mac OS compiler.

Mar 24, 2009, version 1.1.1

    * #include <cstring> added to SPQR/Include/spqr.hpp, required
        by gcc 4.3.2 (but not needed by gcc 4.1.0 or other compilers...).

Sept 20, 2008, version 1.1.0

    * No bugs fixed since no known bugs were present in v1.0.0
    * Added new ordering options, in particular the default ordering:
        - COLAMD if m <= 2*n after removing singletons; otherwise:
          AMD then try METIS if installed and if AMD gives a high fill-in
          and flop count.
    * User Guide, and two draft journal articles (to be submitted to ACM TOMS)
           in the SPQR/Doc directory.
    * Added control of the # of threads used by TBB (it was set
	to the TBB default in version 1.0.0).
    * Additional demos.
    * Added -DTIMING option, and additional components to info output
    * Added spqr_singletons mexFunction
    * Modified example in comments of spqr_assemble.cpp to coincide with article

Aug 21, 2008

    * version 1.0.0
