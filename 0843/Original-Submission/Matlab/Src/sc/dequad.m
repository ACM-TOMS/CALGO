%DEQUAD (not intended for calling directly by the user)

%   z1,z2 are vectors of left and right endpoints.  sing1 is a vector of
%   integer indices which label the singularities in z1.  So if sing1(5)
%   = 3, then z1(5) = z(3).  A zero means no singularity.  z is the
%   vector of prevertices (all singularities except the origin); beta is
%   the vector of associated turning angles.  qdat is quadrature data
%   from SCQDATA.
%
%   Make sure that z and beta are column vectors.
%   
%   DEQUAD integrates from a possible singularity at the left end to a
%   regular point at the right.  If both endpoints are singularities,
%   you must break the integral into two pieces and make two calls.
%   
%   The integral is subdivided, if necessary, so that no singularity
%   lies closer to the left endpoint than 1/2 the length of the
%   integration (sub)interval.  But the singularity at the origin is NOT
%   accounted for in this decision.
