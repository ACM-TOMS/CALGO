function p = forwardpoly(map)
%   Given a riesurfmap F, FORWARDPOLY(F) returns the polygon that is
%   formed using the prevertices, angles, and quadrature data of that
%   map. If the prevertices were found from the solution of a
%   parameter problem, then the result should agree closely with the
%   original polygon that was supplied.
