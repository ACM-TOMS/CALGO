%DQUAD: Numerical quadrature for the disk map.
%   DQUAD(ZL,ZR,S,Z,BETA,QDAT,MIDPT) performs the integration for the SC
%   disk formula. ZL and ZR are vectors of left and right endpoints. S
%   is a vector of integers. If ZL(k) = Z(m), then S(k) should have the
%   value m; otherwise, S(k) should be zero. 
%   
%   Z and BETA are prevertices and turning angles for the SC map. QDAT
%   is a matrix of quadrature data (see SCQDATA). 
%   
%   The integration is adaptive in the sense that members of Z (with
%   nonzero BETA) that are close to the left endpoints cause
%   subdivision. This is NOT true of singularities close to the right end.

%   z1,z2 are vectors of left and right endpoints.  sing1 is a vector of
%   integer indices which label the singularities in z1.  So if sing1(5)
%   = 3, then z1(5) = z(3).  A zero means no singularity.  z is the
%   vector of singularities; beta is the vector of associated turning
%   angles.  qdat is quadrature data from SCQDATA.
%
%   Make sure that z and beta are column vectors.
%   
%   DQUAD integrates from a possible singularity at the left end to a
%   regular point at the right.  If both endpoints are singularities,
%   you must break the integral into two pieces and make two calls.
%   
%   The integral is subdivided, if necessary, so that no singularity
%   lies closer to the left endpoint than 1/2 the length of the
%   integration (sub)interval.
