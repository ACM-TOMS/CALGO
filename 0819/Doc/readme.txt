   This package contains the following files:

 * wrtest.f : test program for aiz and biz

 * src.f :  contains routines, aif and bif for the computation of
            the Airy functions Ai(z) and Bi(z)

 * port.f : computes the machine dependent constants; this uses Fortran 90
	    intrinsic functions to aid portability. If you are running on
	    a Fortran 77 compiler you will need to download algorithm 528
	    or obtain a copy of r1mach/d1mach from netlib. (Note these
	    source files will probably need checking for compatibility
	    with your system.)

 * res1, res2, res3 and res4 : results files generated by wrtest.f
