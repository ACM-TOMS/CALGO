  The model for real numbers in the current installed version,
  obtained with the declaration REAL(KIND=stnd), has the
  following characteristics:
                 base =   2
  digits in this base =  53
  This implies:
             machine epsilon =    2.2204460492503131E-16
         largest real number =   1.7976931348623157E+308
  smallest normalized number =   2.2250738585072014E-308

  The lowest relative error that may be obtained with this
  version is about 0.11E-13
  Asking for lower error will push the routine to use the
  maximal number of function evaluations it is allowed.


  This version accepts a collection of hyper-rectangles
    (and parallelepipeds) and simplices as integration regions.
  Extrapolation using the epsilon-algorithm is available
       for dimensions 1, 2 and 3.
  The following values of KEY give different integration rules:
  - finite interval: KEY = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
       KEY < 1 defaults to 1; KEY > 5 defaults to 5.
  - n-cube:          KEY = 3, 4       uses rule of degree 2*KEY+1
            otherwise, uses for a square a rule of degree 13
                                  3-cube a rule of degree 11
                                         a rule of degree  7
  - n-simplex:       KEY = 1, 2, 3, 4 uses rule of degree 2*KEY+1
          otherwise, uses for a triangle a rule of degree 13
                             tetrahedron a rule of degree  8
                                         a rule of degree  7
  KEY = 0 corresponds to our preferred choice.
