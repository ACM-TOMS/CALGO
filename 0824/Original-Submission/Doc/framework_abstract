CUBPACK: a package for automatic cubature; framework description

Ronald Cools and Ann Haegemans

Abstract:
CUBPACK aims to offer a collection of re-usable code for automatic
n-dimensional (n >= 1) numerical integration of functions over a
collection of regions, i.e., quadrature and cubature.  The current
version allows this region to consist of a union of n-simplices and
n-parellellepids.  The framework of CUBPACK is described as well as
its user interface.  The functionality of several well known routines
is embedded.  New features include integration algorithms using the
epsilon-algorithm for extrapolation for regions other than triangles
and the implementation of a new type of subdivision for 3-cubes.
