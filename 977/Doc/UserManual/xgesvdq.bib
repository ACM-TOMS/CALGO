For m ⩾ n, it decomposes X into the product X = \{UBVT\} where U ∈ Rm×n has orthonormal columns, V ∈ Rn×n is orthogonal, and B ∈ Rn×n is upper bidiagonal. The matrix V is computed as a product of Householder transformations. The matrices U and B are constructed using a recurrence. If U is desired from the computation, the new procedure requires fewer operations than the Golub–Kahan procedure [SIAM J. Num. Anal. Ser. B 2 (1965) 205] and similar procedures. In floating point arithmetic, the columns of U may be far from orthonormal, but that departure from orthonormality is structured. The application of any backward stable singular value decomposition procedure to B recovers the left singular vectors associated with the leading (largest) singular values of X to near orthogonality. The singular values of B are those of X perturbed by no more than f(m, n)εM∥X∥F where f(m, n) is a modestly growing function and εM is the machine unit. Under certain assumptions, relative error bounds on the singular values are possible. "

This work addresses the issue of numerical stability of the transition from H to H′ in finite precision arithmetic. Our analysis shows that the eigenvalues will be computed with small relative error if (i) the approximate eigenvectors are sufficiently orthonormal and (ii) the matrix ||||H′||||=(H′)2 is of the form \{DAD\} with diagonal D and well-conditioned A. In that case, H′ can be efficiently and accurately diagonalized by the Jacobi method. If Ũ is computed by fast eigensolver based on tridiagonalization, this procedure usually gives the eigensolution with high relative accuracy and it is more efficient than accurate Jacobi type methods on their own.

This article discusses how this method can be extended to the bidiagonal \{SVD\} B=UΣVT. It turns out that using the RRR algorithm as a black box to compute BTB=VΣ2VT and BBT=UΣ2UT separately may give poor results for ∥BV−UΣ∥. The use of the standard Jordan–Wielandt representation can fail as well if clusters of tiny singular values are present. A solution is to work on \{BTB\} and to keep factorizations of \{BBT\} implicitly. We introduce a set of coupling transformations which allow us to replace the representation u=1σBv by a more stable representation u=Xv, where X is a diagonal matrix. Numerical results of our implementation are compared with the \{LAPACK\} routines DSTEGR, \{DBDSQR\} and DBDSDC. "

In other papers we have shown that a method based upon this idea may become a serious competitor (in terms of speed) for computing the singular values of large matrices and also that it is well suited for parallel processing. However, there are still some open questions related to the numerical stability of the method and these will be addressed in this paper. The algorithm, as it is at present, is not backward stable. Nevertheless, we give examples of ill-conditioned matrices for which we have been able to produce a bidiagonal form whose singular values are much more accurate than the ones computed with the standard bidiagonalization technique.

For matrices of low rank deficiency, the algorithm is guaranteed to reveal the rank of A, and the cost is only slightly more than the cost of one regular O̧R factorization. A posteriori upper and lower bounds on the singular values of A are derived and can be used to infer the numerical rank of A."

	abstract = {T. Chan has noted that, even when the singular value decomposition of a matrix A is known, it is still not obvious how to find a rank-revealing QR factorization (RRQR) of A if A has numerical rank deficiency. This paper offers a constructive proof of the existence of the RRQR factorization of any matrix A of size m × n with numerical rank r. The bounds derived in this paper that guarantee the existence of RRQR are all of order <tex-math>$\sqrt{nr}$</tex-math>, in comparison with Chan's O(2<sup>n - r</sup>). It has been known for some time that if A is only numerically rank-one deficient, then the column permutation Π of A that guarantees a small r<sub>nn</sub> in the QR factorization of AΠ can be obtained by inspecting the size of the elements of the right singular vector of A corresponding to the smallest singular value of A. To some extent, our paper generalizes this well-known result.},
