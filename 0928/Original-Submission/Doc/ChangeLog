Initial release.  Dantzig-Wolfe Solver (DWSOLVER) is a general, parallel
implementation of the Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition algorithm built upon the
GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK).  This is a command-line only tool.  All
input and output is file-based.  The user must supply a decomposed linear
program as input.  For details, execute "dwsolver --help".  For examples, see
the "examples" directory.  Current major limitations include the necessity of
bounded subproblems, necessity of every master variable appearing in exactly
one subproblem.  For a large number of problems, these are not major issues. 
For other problems, there are some workarounds as described in the examples.
