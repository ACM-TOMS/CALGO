After the download, put the file bvptwp_1.0.zip (or bvptwp_1.0.rar).
in the directory where you want to install
 the solver (bvptwp-path). Uncompressing
 the file should create the entire distribution tree:

   bvptwp-path/bvptwp_1.0
                     private
                     problems 
                     usersmanuals 


The directory private contains all the functions needed to run the solver. 
The directory problems contains all the test problems.
The directory usersmanual contains two manuals to read before to start to use the solver.

* Using the code bvptwp

 Example for MATLAB 7.14:

Launch the following commands:

    [$SHELL] cd  bvptwp-path/bvptwp_1.0
    [$SHELL] matlab
    
    
 In the MATLAB environment:  
 
   >>
   >> shock_bvptwp
   
this will run the problem example described in the file shock_bvptwp.m 
    
   >>
   >> sinh_bvptwp
   
this will run the problem example described in the file sinh_bvptwp.m 
    

* Solving a Test Set problem 

  Example for MATLAB 7.14:

Launch the following commands:

    [$SHELL] cd  bvptwp-path/bvptwp_1.0
    [$SHELL] matlab
    

In the MATLAB environment:

    >> addpath  bvptwp-path/bvptwp_1.0/problems
    >> [sol,time]= bvpMtest(@bvpT1,'twpbvp_l',1e-4,1,[],1e-3)

Solve the problem bvpT1  using the solver twpbvp_l, 
rtol=1e-4, lambda=1e-3, and plot the first component of the solution.



* Solving your own  problem 

First read Section 2 in the  manual_testset  and implement 
your problem by providing *all* routines as described in this section
(sometimes it is necessary to provide a dummy routine to satisfy 
the loader. e.g. in the  case the exact solution is  unknown you have to specify a dummy 
routine for esolu)

        save the problem code in   bvptwp-path/problems


Then use the instruction for solving a generic Test Set problem, 
using the handle of the new problem.

Otherwise read Section 1 in the manual_bvptwp and implement 
your problem  as described in this section.
