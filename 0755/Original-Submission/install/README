   --------------------------------------------------------------
   ADOL-C version 1.6 as of January 1,    1995
   --------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains makefiles and other UNIX scripts.

To produce the ADOL-C library libad.a use the executable 
<operating_system>install (e.g. aixinstall).
It inserts appropriate makefiles into the ADOL-C library
and the two example subdirectories provided.
After that the make command can be invoked as usual:

- in */SRC
make 
will produce the library libad.a

- in */SRC/DEX or */SRC/EXA
make <example_filename>
will build the executable <example_filename>.

The design goals, applicability and some implementation details
of ADOL-C are described in the tared LaTeX file adol-c.doc.tar.
Any difficulties and questions should be reported to:
adol-c@math.tu-dresden.de

AIX: Problems with float constants may occur if the environment variable
LANG is not set to En_US -- test it with: 
set
set it with: 
export LANG=En_US
-- because the compiler may parse constants containing a decimal dot 
not correctly.

GNU: Some source files contain remove and unlink calls.
Although remove complies with the ANSI C standard it turned out, that
in some situations (e.g. using GNU's compilers on a SUN workstation)
unlink has to be used instead of remove. In this case 
change the comment signs in the source where both alternatives 
are offered.
