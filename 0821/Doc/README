In order to build the FPTHRD library files:

1. Change to the source directory

	% cd src

2. Build the object files 

	% build XXXXX 

   where XXXXX is one of the following, depending upon the execution platform

        CPQ     -- Compaq Tru64
        SUN     -- SUN Solais
        IBM     -- IBM AIX Power 3
        SGI     -- SGI Origin running IRIX
        SGI64   -- SGI Origin running IRIX with 64-bit addressing

3. Object and module files will be placed in lib subdirectory.

***************

To build test and benchmark executables:

1. Build FPTHRD files (see above)

2. Change to tests directory:

	% cd tests

3. Build the test executable files 

	% make -f Makefile.XXXXXX

   where XXXXX is one of the following, depending upon the execution platform

	origin   --  SGI Origin 2000
	power3   --  IBM Power3 SMP
	sun      --  SUN Enterprise System
        cpq      --  Compaq ES40 System

   *NOTE*  Be sure the BITS make variable match those used in step 1.  
           Also remove any old copies of object files or module output.

4. Run executables test1, test2, test3, and test4.  All codes passed their 
   tests when this work was submitted to ACM-TOMS for publication.

The *critical* step in using threads on the SUN is including the -stackvar 
flag.  Use it on the compile and linking steps.  Codes won't usually work 
without this flag.
