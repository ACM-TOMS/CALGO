Running small BEDFix test...


BEDFix residual criterion method, epsilon = 0.000100, q = 1.000000
number of tests performed = 65025
number of tests with errors or results not satisfying criterion = 0
average number of evaluations = 9.113833
2*log_2(1/epsilon)+1=29
number of tests with 2*log_2(1/epsilon)+1 evaluations = 0
number of tests satisfying absolute error criterion = 22413
average ratio of evaluations to 2*log_2(1/epsilon)+1 = 0.314270
average ratio of evaluations to 2*log_2(1/epsilon)+1
when absolute criterion satisfied = 0.419441
minimum and maximum function evaluations = 3, 23
