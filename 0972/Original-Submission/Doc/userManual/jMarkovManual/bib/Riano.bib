  abstract = {In recent years, well-designed bus rapid transit (BRT) systems have
	become a real alternative to more expensive rail-based public transportation
	systems around the world. However, once the BRT system is operational,
	its success often depends on the routes offered to passengers. Thus,
	the bus rapid transit route design problem (BRTRDP) is the problem
	of finding a set of routes and frequencies that minimizes the operational
	and passenger costs (travel time) while simultaneously satisfying
	the system's technical constraints, such as meeting the demands for
	trips, bus frequencies, and lane capacities. To address this problem,
	we propose a mathematical formulation of the BRTRDP as a mixed-integer
	program (MIP) with an underlying network structure. However, because
	of the vast number of routes, solving the MIP via branch and bound
	is out of reach for most practical instances. Hence, we propose a
	decomposition strategy that, given a certain set of routes, decouples
	the route selection decisions from the BRT system performance evaluation.
	The latter evaluation is done by solving a linear optimization problem
	using a column generation scheme. We embedded this decomposition
	strategy in a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) and tested it in 14
	instances ranging from 5 to 40 stations with different BRT system
	topologies. The results show that in 8 of 14 problems, the HGA was
	able to obtain a solution that is provably optimal within 0.20%.
	Additionally, in 4 of 14 instances, HGA obtained the optimal solution.},
