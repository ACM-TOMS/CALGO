	concomitantly (dynamic), and those assuming that the demands for
	the different fare classes arrive separately in a predetermined order
	(static). We present a coherent framework linking these seemingly
	disparate models through the underlying dynamic program common to
	both. We develop a discrete-time Markov decision process formulation
	mirroring that of Janakiram et al. Transp. Sci. 33, 147{\^a}€“167
	(1999) to solve the single-leg problem without cancellations, overbooking,
	or discounting. Borrowing a result from the queueing-control literature,
	we prove the concavity of the associated optimal value functions
	and, subsequently, the optimality of a booking limit policy. We then
	apply this same technique to the more influential papers from the
	single-leg literature, at once unifying the static and dynamic models
	and establishing the connection between the yield-management and
	queueing-control problems. Finally, we propose an omnibus formulation
	that yields the static and dynamic models as special cases.}

  month = {Mar},
  abstract = {In this paper we focus on networks of infinite-server queues with
	nonhomogeneousPoisson arrival processes. We start by introducing
	a more general Poisson-arrival-locationmodel (PALM) in which arrivals
	move independently through a general statespace according to a location
	stochastic process after arriving accordingto a nonhomogeneous Poisson
	process. The usual open network of infinite-serverqueues, which is
	also known as a linear population process or a linearstochastic compartmental
	model, arises in the special case of a finitestate space. The mathematical
	foundation is a Poisson-random-measure representation,which can be
	obtained by stochastic integration. It implies a time-dependentproduct-form
	result: For appropriate initial conditions, the queue lengths(numbers
	of customers in disjoint subsets of the state space) at any timeare
	independent Poisson random variables. Even though there is no dependenceamong
	the queue lengths at each time, there is important dependence amongthe
	queue lengths at different times. We show that the joint distributionis
	multivariate Poisson, and calculate the covariances. A unified frameworkfor
	constructing stochastic processes of interest is provided by stochasticallyintegrating
	various functionals of the location process with respect tothe Poisson
	arrival process. We use this approach to study the flows inthe queueing
	network; e.g., we show that the aggregate arrival and departureprocesses
	at a given queue (to and from other queues as well as outsidethe
	network) are generalized Poisson processes (without necessarily havinga
	rate or unit jumps) if and only if no customer can visit that queue
	morethan once. We also characterize the aggregate arrival and departure
	processeswhen customers can visit the queues more frequently. In
	addition to obtainingstructural results, we use the stochastic integrals
	to obtain explicitexpressions for time-dependent means and covariances.
	We do this in twoways. First, we decompose the entire network into
	a superposition of independentnetworks with fixed deterministic routes.
	Second, we make Markov assumptions,initially for the evolution of
	the routes and finally for the entire locationprocess. For Markov
	routing among the queues, the aggregate arrival ratesare obtained
	as the solution to a system of input equations, which havea unique
	solution under appropriate qualifications, but not in general.Linear
	ordinary differential equations characterize the time-dependentmeans
	and covariances in the totally Markovian case.},

	birth-death processes) approach for the exact analysis of M/G/1 and
	GI/M/1-type processes, and their intersection, i.e., quasi birth-death
	processes. ETAQA exploits the repetitive structure of the infinite
	portion of the chain and derives a finite system of linear equations.
	In contrast to the classic techniques for solution of such systems,
	the solution of this finite linear system does not provide the entire
	probability distribution of the state space, but simply allows calculation
	of the aggregate probability of a finite set of classes of states
	from the state space, appropriately defined. Nonetheless, these aggregate
	probabilities allow for computation of a rich set of measures of
	interest such as the system queue length or any of its higher moments.
	The proposed solution approach is exact and, for the case of M/G/1-type
	processes, compares favorably to the classic methods as shown by
	detailed time and space complexity analysis. Detailed experimentation
	further corroborates that ETAQA provides significantly less expensive
	solutions when compared to the classic methods.},
