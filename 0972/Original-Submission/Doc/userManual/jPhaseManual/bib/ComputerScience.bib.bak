	of interest that can be derived is the caudal curve. This measure
	gives insight in the "tail behaviour" of the queue.
	
	With MGMtool models are specified via C procedure calls. This turns
	out to be a very flexible approach for modelling queueing systems;
	it also allows for the easy evaluation of models over parameter ranges.

  abstract = {SMAQ is a measurement-based tool for integration of traffic modeling
	and queuing analysis. There are three basic components in SMAQ. In
	the design of the first component, statistic measurement, the most
	critical issues are to identify the important statistics of traffic
	for queuing analysis in a finite buffer system and then to build
	a measurement structure to collect them.
	
	Our study indicates that both first- and second-order traffic statistics,
	measured within a given frequency-window, have a very significant
	impact on queue length and loss rate performance. In the design of
	the second component, matched modeling, the focal point is to construct
	a stochastic model that can match a wide range of important statistics
	collected in various applications. New methodologies and fast algorithms
	are developed for such construction on basis of circulant modulated
	Poisson process (CMPP). For the third component, queuing solutions,
	the basic requirement is to provide numerical solutions of queue
	length and loss rate for transport of given traffic in a finite buffer
	system. A fast and stable computation method, called a Folding algorithm,
	is applied to provide both steady-state and transient solutions of
	various kinds, including congestion control performance where arriving
	traffic are selectively discarded based on queue thresholds. In this
	first part of the article, we provide both design methodologies and
	software architectures of these three components, with discussion
	of practical engineering issues for the use of SMAQ tool. A trial
	version of the Web-based SMAQ tool can be found on our Web site at
	http://www.apollo.ece.utexas.edu.},

  publisher = {Prentice Hall},
  year = {2004},
  author = {van der Linden, Peter},
  edition = {6th},
  abstract = {The first edition of Just Java was one of the earliest books to accompany
	the original release of Java in 1996. The launch of Java coincided
	with the explosion of interest in the web and the net which, in turn,
	drove technology forward at a frantic pace. People talked about Internet
	time, which meant three things to me in Silicon Valley: there was
	immense pressure to rapidly create new hardware and software products;
	everyone wrote software to display stock prices on their desktops
	and cell phones; you were forgiven for not showering if you fell
	asleep at your desk after midnight and woke up there the next morning.
	Times have changed, but software productivity remains a big reason
	behind Java's popularity. Over the last eight years Java has had
	six major releases, averaging one about every 18 months. With each
	of these releases, there has been a new edition of Just Java to describe
	and explain the technology. This is a remarkable pace of development
	for a programming system, particularly when Sun keeps such an emphasis
	on backward compatibility and portability. The Java 1.2 release was
	a significant one, bundling major functionality improvements like
	the collection classes and the Swing GUI library. Java 1.3 and 1.4
	were comparatively smaller, although 1.4 did bring a new statement
	( assert ) into the language. Two and a half years in the making,
	Java 1.5 is the biggest version yet. It is bigger and more significant
	than jdk 1.2. Sun will probably rename Java 1.5 to some awkward and
	confusing name using two sets of numbers, like Java 2 Mega-edition
	v1.5 fab-o-lux . Whatever they call it, think of Java 1.5 as Java
	3 . There are also the traditional bug-fix, library and performance
	improvements, including some exciting optimizations for desktop applications.Over
	the years, I've put a lot of hard work into unlocking the changes
	in Java, so you don't have to. You're looking at the results of that
	effort: the sixth edition of Just Java . I'm confident you'll find
	it easy to read, and packed with the information you need. I hope
	that you'll want a copy for yourself. But if not, I want you to put
	it back on the shelf, only (as my friend Alan Abel suggested) in
	a more prominent position. -;P.},
