  abstract = {Previous work on the dynamics of bucket brigades has focused on systems
	in which workers can be ordered with respect to their speeds and
	where this ordering does not change throughout the line. While this
	assumption is valid in most environments, it may not be satisfied
	in some. We consider such environments and explore the conditions
	under which bucket brigades continue to be effective (compared to
	a traditional static allocation) with respect to self-balancing behavior
	and throughput performance. A two worker bucket brigade is studied
	where one worker is faster than the other over some part of the production
	line and slower over another part of the line. We analyze the dynamics
	and throughput of the bucket brigade in two environments with passing
	and blocking. We present the dynamics of the system in each region
	of the parameter space and provide insights and operating principles
	for the implementation and management of the bucket brigades under
	various scenarios.},
