% [Collisions,Overlappings,Pos] =  EvalChain(vector)
% EvalChain: Given a chain of molecules in the HP model, calculates the numer of Collisions with 
% neighboring same sign molecules, and the number of Overlappings molecules.

% INPUTS
% vector: Sequence of residues ( (H)ydrophobic or (P)olar, respectively represented by zero and one)
% OUTPUTS
% Collisions:   Number of non contiguous H residues that are neighbors in the lattice 
% Ovelappings:  Number of residues that self-intersect in the lattice
% Pos:    Position of the residues
