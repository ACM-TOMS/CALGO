% [Cliques] = CreateTreeStructure(MI)
% CreateTreeStructure: A maximum weighted tree is learned from the matrix of mutual information between the variables
% INPUTS
% MI: Matrix of mutual information
% OUTPUTS
%    Cliques: Structure of the model in a list of cliques that defines the neighborhood 
%    Each row of Cliques is a clique. The first value is the number of parents for variable i (1 in the case of a tree). 
%    The second, is the number of new variables (one new variable, i).
%    Then, parent variables are listed and  finally new variables (variable i) are listed
