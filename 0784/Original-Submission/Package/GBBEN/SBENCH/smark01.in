*              **** GEMM-Based Level 3 BLAS Benchmark ****
*                                SMARK01
*
*
*  We propose two standard test suits for the collected benchmark
*  result, SMARK01 and SMARK02 (see the files 'smark01.in' and
*  'smark02.in'). These tests are designed to show performance of the
*  user-supplied Level 3 library for problem sizes that are likely to
*  often be requested by a calling routine. This imply problems that
*  presumably constitute a large part of computations in routines which
*  use the Level 3 BLAS as their major computational kernels. LAPACK
*  implements blocked algorithms which are based on calls to the Level 3
*  BLAS. The problems in the two tests are similar. However, some of the
*  matrix dimensions are larger in SMARK02 than in SMARK01. This
*  corresponds to larger matrix blocks in the calling routine. The tests
*  are expected to match various target machines differently.
*  Performance results may depend strongly on sizes of different storage
*  units in the memory hierarchy. The size of the cache memory, for
*  instance, may be decisive. For this reason, we propose two standard
*  tests instead of one.
