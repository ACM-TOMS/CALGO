      LOGICAL FUNCTION SGB90( IP, DIM1, DIM2 )
*     .. Scalar Arguments ..
      INTEGER                IP, DIM1, DIM2
*     ..
*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SGB90 determines which of two alternative code sections in a GEMM-
*  Based Level 3 BLAS routine that will be the fastest for a particular
*  problem. If the problem is considered large enough SGB90 returns
*  .TRUE., otherwise .FALSE. is returned. The input parameter IP
*  specifies the calling routine and a break point for alternative code
*  sections. The input parameters DIM1 and DIM2 are matrix dimensions.
*  The returned value is a function of the input parameters and the
*  performance characteristics of the two alternative code sections.
*
*  In this simple implementation, the returned values are determined by
*  looking at only one of the two dimensions DIM1 and DIM2. It may be
*  rewarding to rewrite the logical expressions in SGB90 so that both
*  dimensions are involved. The returned values should effectively
*  reflect the performance characteristics of the underlying BLAS
*  routines.
*
*
*  Input
*  =====
*
*  IP     - INTEGER
*           On entry, IP specifies which routine and which alternative
*           code sections that the decision is intended for.
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  DIM1   - INTEGER.
*           On entry, DIM1 specifies the first dimension in the calling
*           sequence of the Level 3 routine specified by IP.
*           Unchanged on exit.
*
*  DIM2   - INTEGER.
*           On entry, DIM2 specifies the second dimension in the
*           calling sequence of the Level 3 routine specified by IP.
*           Unchanged on exit.
