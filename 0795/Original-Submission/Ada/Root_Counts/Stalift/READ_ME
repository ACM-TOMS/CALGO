Mixed-volume computation and polyhedral continuation by static lifting.

The algorithm used is based on the construction of a mixed subdivision,
based on Betke's formula for mixed volumes and the polyhedral homotopy
continuation methods developed by Huber and Sturmfels.

This library features integer-valued and floating-point lifting functions.
The implementation of integer static lifting typically induces nested
subdivisions, with non-fine cells recursively refined by subdivisions.
