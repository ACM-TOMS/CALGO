Increment-and-fix tracking of solution paths of polynomial homotopies.

This library of continuation routines is organized in three layers:

  0. The basic data structures
  1. Increment-and-Fix continuation
  2. Driver routines

0. The basic data structures

   The package Continuation_Data defines records of data to allow better
management during continuation.  Settings of the continuation parameters
can be determined interactively by the routines in
Continuation_Parameters_io, default values are contained in the package
Continuation_Parameters.  In Process_io are the primitive operations
for output during continuation, depending on the output mode.

1. Increment-and-Fix continuation

   There is a rich variety of predictors available.
Increment-and-fix continuation with a polyhedral end game for the
computation of the directions of the solution paths.

2. Driver routines

     batchpoco         Batch_Polynomial_Continuations
     mainpoco          poco as called by the main program
     scanpoco          Scanners_for_Continuation
     bablpoco          batch processing and black box version of poco
     valipoco          validation of computed path directions

3. target routines :

     poco              poco  (Polynomial Continuation)
     postpoco          stand-alone routine for validation of path directions
