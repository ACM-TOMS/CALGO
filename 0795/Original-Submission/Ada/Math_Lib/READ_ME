Mathematical library with basic data structures and operations.

  Math_Lib             : 1. general mathematical library
     |-- Numbers       : 1.1. number representations
     |-- Matrices      : 1.2. matrices and linear-system solvers

     |-- Supports      : 1.4. support sets and linear programming

The directory Numbers specifies the coefficient rings and contains 
definitions of floating-point and complex numbers.
The coefficient rings are implemented by means of packages that can 
be used for instantiating generic packages.

In Matrices we find a generic package vectors, matrices of integer,
floating-point and complex numbers.
Solvers of linear systems are provided.

The directory Polynomials contains the packages to deal with
multivariate polynomials and systems.

To deal with support sets and polytopes, linear-programming
methods have been implemented in the directory Supports.
