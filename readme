The ACM Algorithms Policy says, in part,

Dissemination Agreement

Submittal of an algorithm for publication in one of the ACM
Transactions implies that unrestricted use of the algorithm
within a computer is permissible.  General permission to
copy and distribute the algorithm without fee is granted
provided that the copies are not made or distributed for
direct commercial advantage.  The ACM copyright notice and
the title of the publication and its date appear, and
notice is given that copying is by permission of the
Association for Computing Machinery.  To copy otherwise,
or to republish, requires a fee and/or specific permission.


ACM sells the journal and the algorithms (separately).  For
current price and ordering information, look at an issue of
