SDPARA 7.3.1 Install Manual

We assume that LAPACK, BLAS, BLACS, SCALAPACK and MPI are 
installed corretly.
If you have trouble on the installation, please let us know
by e-mail (sdpa-developers at lists dot sourceforge dot net).

1. Edit Makefile

Edit default values for your environment.

Note that DEF_F77_FUNC is decided by your compiler and MPI.
In Makefile, we list 4 candidates for DEF_F77_FUNC.
(The number of underscore and parenthesis escape are different.)


2. Compile MUMPS
The following command compiles MUMPS in the sub-directory 'mumps'.

$ make mumps

This command will automatically download MUMPS package 
via 'wget' command.
If you need to recompile MUMPS by some trouble, then type 
$ make mumps-clean; make mumps

3. Compile SDPARA

The following command compiles SDPARA.

$ make

4. Test SDPARA

The following command executes SDPARA using 'example1.dat-s'
as sample input with two nodes and four threads on each node.

$ mpirun -np 2 ./sdpara example1.dat-s example1.result -numThreads 4

The options of SDPARA executable are the same as SDPA.

SDPARA supports only command executables, i.e., it does not support
callable library and matlab interface.
