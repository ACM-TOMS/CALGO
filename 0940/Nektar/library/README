Misc Notes about the build process, should be put in a better location.

ACML 3.6
--------
* Linking statically to the ifortran verison requires ifortran libraries.
* Linking dynamically to the ifortran version had unexplained crashes and just general strange behavior.

* The PGI versions seems to work.

MKL 8.1.1
---------
32 bit linux version appears to be working fine.
