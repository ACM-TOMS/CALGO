It is never necessary to compile the GENIAL library, because it can always be used with the header files, just like the STL.
You should nevertheless envisage to compile it, if you plan to use functions that are particularly time intensive for compilers (FFT, BLAS...)

Follow the following steps to compile GENIAL on a Unix platform. 
 
  - Edit the 'genial_config.h' header file, and set the options you wish. Especially consider the /FFT_PRECOMPILE/ and /BLAS_PRECOMPILE/ directives.
  
  - According to your compiler:
    1) For GCC, type one of the following command according the SIMD instructions you want to use:
       > ./configure
       > ./configure CXXFLAGS="-mmmx"
       > ./configure CXXFLAGS="-msse"
       > ./configure CXXFLAGS="-msse2"
       > ./configure CXXFLAGS="-msse3"
    2) For ICC, type the following command:
       > ./configure CXX=icc CPPFLAGS="-no-gcc"
    Optionally use other parameters to set the installation location, to switch between debug and release mode, etc...
  
  - Type one of the following command according to the place where the library should be installed :
    > make
    > make install
