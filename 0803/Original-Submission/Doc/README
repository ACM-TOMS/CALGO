   INSTALLATION
     
        To install m5, do the following (examples use csh).
        NOTE: If you want to install into a system directory you will need to
        login as "root" or get your system administrator to do this.
     
        a. Copy m5 into the appropriate system bin directory; e.g.,
           % cp m5 m5.awk /usr/local/bin
           or into your local bin directory; e.g.,
           % cp m5 m5.awk /home/smith/bin
     
        b. Make sure this bin directory is on your executable path; e.g.,
           % echo $PATH
     
        c. Make sure m5 is executable; e.g.,
           % chmod a+x m5
     
        d. Determine what new awk is called on your system (awk, gawk,
           nawk,...); you may need help from your system administrator on
           this, or you may be able to type the awk command and see if you
           get a positive response; e.g.,
           % nawk
     
        e. Edit the file m5 so that the shell variable AWK is assigned the
           name you determined in part d.; e.g.,
           % vi m5
     
        f. If all is well, you should be able to try any of the following
           % m5 testdata.m5 > out
           % m5 < testdata.m5 > out
           % cat testdata.m5 | m5 > out
     
        g. After executing (one of) the above, files testdata.awk and a.awk
           should be the same, and files testdata.out and out should be the
           same.
           % diff testdata.awk a.awk
           % diff testdata.out out
