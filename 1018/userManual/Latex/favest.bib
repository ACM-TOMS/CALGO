Although the main components of the algorithm are similar in spirit to the 2D caseâ€”spectral approximation in space, semi-implicit time-stepping schemeâ€”the main differences are that the bending and viscous force require new analysis, the linearization for the semi-implicit schemes must be rederived, a fully implicit scheme must be used for the toroidal topology to eliminate a CFL-type restriction and a novel numerical scheme for the evaluation of the 3D Stokes single layer potential on an axisymmetric surface is necessary to speed up the calculations. By introducing these novel components, we obtain a time-scheme that experimentally is unconditionally stable, has low cost per time step, and is third-order accurate in time. We present numerical results to analyze the cost and convergence rates of the scheme. To verify the solver, we compare it to a constrained variational approach to compute equilibrium shapes that does not involve interactions with a viscous fluid. To illustrate the applicability of method, we consider a few vesicle-flow interaction problems: the sedimentation of a vesicle, interactions of one and three vesicles with a background Poiseuille flow."

Although the main components of the algorithm are similar in spirit to the axisymmetric case (spectral approximation in space, semi-implicit time-stepping scheme), important new elements need to be introduced for a full 3D method. In particular, spatial quantities are discretized using spherical harmonics, and quadrature rules for singular surface integrals need to be adapted to this case; an algorithm for surface reparameterization is needed to ensure stability of the time-stepping scheme, and spectral filtering is introduced to maintain reasonable accuracy while minimizing computational costs. To characterize the stability of the scheme and to construct preconditioners for the iterative linear system solvers used in the semi-implicit time-stepping scheme, we perform a spectral analysis of the evolution operator on the unit sphere. By introducing these algorithmic components, we obtain a time-stepping scheme that circumvents the stability constraint on the time-step and achieves spectral accuracy in space. We present results to analyze the cost and convergence rates of the overall scheme. To illustrate the applicability of the new method, we consider a few vesicle-flow interaction problems: a single vesicle in relaxation, sedimentation, shear flows, and many-vesicle flows."

The calculation is based on localization of the path integral for the index. Our index counts supersymmetric gauge invariant operators containing inclusions of magnetic monopole operators, where latter operators create magnetic fluxes on 2-sphere. Through analytic and numerical calculations in various sectors, we show that our result perfectly agrees with the index over supersymmetric gravitons in $AdS_4\times S_7/\mathbb{Z}_k$ in the large N limit. Monopole operators in nontrivial representations of $U(N)\times —U(N)$ play important roles. We also comment on possible applications of our methods to other superconformal Chernâ€“Simons theories."
