Instructions
---
In order to run these examples, you will need a recent version of matlab(version 6.0 or later). You can run these automatically by typing at the shell prompt:
	matlab -r exampleX
where X is a number from 1 to 7.
For example
	matlab -r exmaple3
runs the third example in the paper.

If you wish to output the data to a logfile, you can run
	matlab -r exampleX -logfile filename
where filename is the name of the file you want to save the output as.
Note that you may not get the same numbers for the CPU time in general
depending on the machine on which you run the examples. For example:
	matlab -r example2 -logfile ex2.out
saves the data to the file ex2.out.

Finally if you wish to run all the examples at once, you can run the command
	matlab -r runall


A copy of all the corresponding output files are stored in exampleX.out and
runall.out.

IMPORTANT
---
You must have all the files in the same directory or in the search path for
matlab m-files. In addition, the eigifp.m file should either be in the m-file
search path on in the directory with these example files.
