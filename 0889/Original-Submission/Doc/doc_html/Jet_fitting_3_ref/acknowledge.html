<P>

CGAL is implemented for the most part by researchers.  The academic
world evaluates and rewards researchers for a good part by the
analysis of the number of published papers and the number of citations
of their papers, which measures their impact.  In order to make the
CGAL project attractive for researchers to contribute their work
(which allows users to benefit from new contributions), we are pushing
a model where the CGAL manual chapters are considered like
publications, and can be cited in articles as such.<BR>

We therefore kindly ask users to cite CGAL as appropriately as
possible in their papers, and to mention the use of CGAL on the web
pages of their <a href="http://www.cgal.org/projects.html">projects using CGAL</a>
and provide us with links to these web pages.  Feel free to contact us
in case you have any question or remark on this topic.</p>
<P>

We provide bibtex entries for the chapters of the 
<em>User and Reference Manual</em>, as well as for
publications directly related to the CGAL software.</p>
