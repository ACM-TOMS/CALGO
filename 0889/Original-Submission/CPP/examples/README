--------------------- 
takes as input a <inputPoints.txt> which is a xyz text file 
it compute the fitting for this single entry and 
it outputs results in the <output.txt> file and on the standard std::cout

Usage is : Single_estimation <inputPoints.txt> <d_fitting>, <d_monge>" 

in_points are sampled on 0.1(x²+2y²)

./Single_estimation data/in_points_file.txt  2 2
./Single_estimation data/in_points_d4.txt  4 4
