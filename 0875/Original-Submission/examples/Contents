This directory should contain:

dsdp.c -- a mex function that connects the DSDP solver to Matlab

readsdpa.c -- a driver routine that reads SDPA formatted files and
              calls the DSDP solver

maxcut.c -- reads a graph, formulates the SDP relaxation of the
           maximum cut problem, calls the DSDP solver, and applies
           a randomized algorithm for integer solutions.
theta.c -- reads a graph, formulates the Lovasz theta problem, defines
          several new matrix structures that are convenient and efficient,
          and calls the DSDP solver.
color.c -- reads a graph, formulates an SDP relaxation of the k-coloring
          problem that includes SDP cones and a LP Bounds Cone, 
          and calls the DSDP solver.
