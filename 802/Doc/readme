Random variate generation software ALC2DLIB can generate random pairs from
arbitrary log-concave 2-dimensional distributions.

It is the implementation of the Algorithm ALC2D described in the paper:

"Wolfgang H"ormann: An automatic generator for bivariate log-concave distributions"

The software contains the follwing files:

  readme  ... this file
  alc2d.c ... C-source of the algorithm
  alc2d.h ... header file also containing explanations for the use of the functions
  
  main1.c ... simple demonstration of the use of the algorithm 
              for the standard normal distribution
  main2.c ... demonstration of the use of the algorithm for several distributions
  mainnort.c ... Chi2-test for the bivariate normal distribution generated
                 with Algorithm ALC2D 


The software was developped with the GNU-C-compiler under LINUX. It was 
tested on a SUN-Workstation using the GNU-C-compiler and
under ULTRIX using the ULTRIX C-compiler as-well.
