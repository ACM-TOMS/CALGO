     X-F-W Data supply for smoothing from datafile  "XFWDAT" .

     Just below, input number of monotonic sections < 16
5

     WARNING: 
      Required number of monotonic sections   =    5
      is greater than/equal to number of data =    1
      it is recommended: 1<= Number Monotonic Sections < Number of data


     There is only one data point, so data itself
      is the required approximation.
      Now number of monotonic sections is exactly 0.


     (Termination due to subroutine TRIVIA.)


     -------------------------------------------------
     Best piecewise monotonic approximation to the data
     from file "XFWDAT" is now kept in file ..."WPMAPP".

     Indices of extrema of best approximation are now
     kept in file ............................"WIVAPP".

     Indices of spline representation of best apprxmtn
     are now kept in file ....................."WIAKN".

     Indices of active constraints of best apprxtn and 
     Lagrange multipliers are now kept in file "WACTLG".
