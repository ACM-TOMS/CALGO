Jan. 21, 2004: AMD Version 1.1

    * No bugs found or fixed - new features added, only
    * amd_preprocess added, to allow for more general input of the matrix A.
    * ME=0 added to amd*.f, unused DEXT variable removed from amdbar.f,
	to avoid spurious compiler warnings (this was not a bug).
    * amd_demo2.c and amd_demo2.out added, to test/demo amd_preprocess.
    * option to allow compile-time redefinition of malloc, free, printf added
    * amd_demo.c shortened slightly (removed printing of PAP')
    * User Guide modified (more details added)
    * linewidth reduced from 80 to 79 columns

Oct. 7, 2003:  AMD version 1.0.1.

    * MATLAB mexFunction modified, to remove call to mexCallMATLAB function.
      This function can take a long time to call, particularly if you are
      ordering many small matrices.

May 6, 2003:  AMD Version 1.0 released.

    * converted to C (compare amd.f and amdbar.f with amd_2.c)
    * dense rows/column removed prior to ordering
    * elimination tree post-ordering added
    * demos, user guide written
    * statistics added (nz in L, flop count, symmetry of A)
    * computes the pattern of A+A' if A is unsymmetric
    * user's input matrix no longer overwritten
    * degree lists initialized differently
    * IOVFLO argument removed from Fortran versions (amd.f and amdbar.f)
    * parameters added (dense row/column detection, aggressive absorption)
    * MATLAB mexFunction added

Jan, 1996:

    * amdbar.f posted at http://www.netlib.org (with a restricted License)
    * amd.f appears as MC47B/BD in the Harwell Subroutine Library
	(without the IOVFLO argument)
