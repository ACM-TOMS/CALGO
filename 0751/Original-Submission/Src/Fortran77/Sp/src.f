C
C   This subroutine provides for creation of a constrained
C Delaunay triangulation which, in some sense, covers an
C arbitrary connected region R rather than the convex hull
C of the nodes.  This is achieved simply by forcing the
C presence of certain adjacencies (triangulation arcs) cor-
C responding to constraint curves.  The union of triangles
C coincides with the convex hull of the nodes, but triangles
C in R can be distinguished from those outside of R.  The
C only modification required to generalize the definition of
C the Delaunay triangulation is replacement of property 5
C (refer to TRMESH) by the following:
C
C  5')  If a node is contained in the interior of the cir-
C       cumcircle of a triangle, then every interior point
C       of the triangle is separated from the node by a
C       constraint arc.
C
C   In order to be explicit, we make the following defini-
C tions.  A constraint region is the open interior of a
C simple closed positively oriented polygonal curve defined
C by an ordered sequence of three or more distinct nodes
C (constraint nodes) P(1),P(2),...,P(K), such that P(I) is
C adjacent to P(I+1) for I = 1,...,K with P(K+1) = P(1).
C Thus, the constraint region is on the left (and may have
C nonfinite area) as the sequence of constraint nodes is
C traversed in the specified order.  The constraint regions
C must not contain nodes and must not overlap.  The region
C R is the convex hull of the nodes with constraint regions
C excluded.
C
C   Note that the terms boundary node and boundary arc are
C reserved for nodes and arcs on the boundary of the convex
C hull of the nodes.
C
C   The algorithm is as follows:  given a triangulation
C which includes one or more sets of constraint nodes, the
C corresponding adjacencies (constraint arcs) are forced to
C be present (Subroutine EDGE).  Any additional new arcs
C required are chosen to be locally optimal (satisfy the
C modified circumcircle property).

C
C On input:
C
C       NCC = Number of constraint curves (constraint re-
C             gions).  NCC .GE. 0.
C
C       LCC = Array of length NCC (or dummy array of length
C             1 if NCC = 0) containing the index (for X, Y,
C             and LEND) of the first node of constraint I in
C             LCC(I) for I = 1 to NCC.  Thus, constraint I
C             contains K = LCC(I+1) - LCC(I) nodes, K .GE.
C             3, stored in (X,Y) locations LCC(I), ...,

C       N = Number of nodes in the triangulation, including
C           constraint nodes.  N .GE. 3.
C
C       X,Y = Arrays of length N containing the coordinates
C             of the nodes with non-constraint nodes in the
C             first LCC(1)-1 locations, followed by NCC se-
C             quences of constraint nodes.  Only one of
C             these sequences may be specified in clockwise
C             order to represent an exterior constraint
C             curve (a constraint region with nonfinite
C             area).
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this routine.
C
C       LWK = Length of IWK.  This must be at least 2*NI
C             where NI is the maximum number of arcs which
C             intersect a constraint arc to be added.  NI
C             is bounded by N-3.
C
C       IWK = Integer work array of length LWK (used by
C             Subroutine EDGE to add constraint arcs).

C                        gulation.  Refer to Subroutine

C On output:
C
C       LWK = Required length of IWK unless IER = 1 or IER =
C             3.  In the case of IER = 1, LWK is not altered
C             from its input value.
C

C             call to Subroutine EDGE.
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND = Triangulation data structure with
C                        all constraint arcs present unless
C                        IER .NE. 0.  These arrays are not
C                        altered if IER = 1.

C       IER = Error indicator:
C             IER = 0 if no errors were encountered.
C             IER = 1 if NCC, N, or an LCC entry is outside
C                     its valid range, or LWK .LT. 0 on
C                     input.
C             IER = 2 if more space is required in IWK.
C             IER = 3 if the triangulation data structure is
C                     invalid, or failure (in EDGE or OPTIM)
C                     was caused by collinear nodes on the
C                     convex hull boundary.  An error mes-
C                     sage is written to logical unit 6 in
C                     this case.
C             IER = 4 if intersecting constraint arcs were
C                     encountered.
C             IER = 5 if a constraint region contains a
C                     node.

C
C   Given a triangulation of N nodes in the plane created by
C Subroutine TRMESH or TRMSHR, this subroutine updates the
C data structure with the addition of a new node in position
C K.  If node K is inserted into X and Y (K .LE. N) rather
C than appended (K = N+1), then a corresponding insertion
C must be performed in any additional arrays associated
C with the nodes.  For example, an array of data values Z
C must be shifted down to open up position K for the new
C value:  set Z(I+1) to Z(I) for I = N,N-1,...,K.  For
C optimal efficiency, new nodes should be appended whenever
C possible.  Insertion is necessary, however, to add a non-
C constraint node when constraints are present (refer to
C Subroutine ADDCST).
C
C   Note that a constraint node cannot be added by this
C routine.  In order to insert a constraint node, it is
C necessary to add the node with no constraints present
C (call this routine with NCC = 0), update LCC by increment-
C ing the appropriate entries, and then create (or restore)
C the constraints by a call to ADDCST.
C
C   The algorithm consists of the following steps:  node K
C is located relative to the triangulation (TRFIND), its
C index is added to the data structure (INTADD or BDYADD),
C and a sequence of swaps (SWPTST and SWAP) are applied to
C the arcs opposite K so that all arcs incident on node K
C and opposite node K (excluding constraint arcs) are local-
C ly optimal (satisfy the circumcircle test).  Thus, if a
C (constrained) Delaunay triangulation is input, a (con-
C strained) Delaunay triangulation will result.  All indexes
C are incremented as necessary for an insertion.
C

C
C       IST = Index of a node at which TRFIND begins the

C tion.  It may be used to remove a null triangle from the
C convex hull boundary.  Note, however, that if the union of
C triangles is rendered nonconvex, Subroutines DELNOD, EDGE,
C and TRFIND may fail.  Thus, Subroutines ADDCST, ADDNOD,
C DELNOD, EDGE, and NEARND should not be called following
C an arc deletion.

C   This subroutine deletes a neighbor NB from the adjacency
C list of node N0 (but N0 is not deleted from the adjacency
C list of NB) and, if NB is a boundary node, makes N0 a
C boundary node.  For pointer (LIST index) LPH to NB as a

C in with the values at LNEW-1, pointer LNEW-1 (in LPTR and

C   This subroutine deletes node K (along with all arcs
C incident on node K) from a triangulation of N nodes in the
C plane, and inserts arcs as necessary to produce a triangu-
C lation of the remaining N-1 nodes.  If a Delaunay triangu-
C lation is input, a Delaunay triangulation will result, and
C thus, DELNOD reverses the effect of a call to Subroutine
C ADDNOD.

C
C   Given a triangulation of N nodes and a pair of nodal
C indexes IN1 and IN2, this routine swaps arcs as necessary
C to force IN1 and IN2 to be adjacent.  Only arcs which
C intersect IN1-IN2 are swapped out.  If a Delaunay triangu-
C lation is input, the resulting triangulation is as close
C as possible to a Delaunay triangulation in the sense that
C all arcs other than IN1-IN2 are locally optimal.
C
C   A sequence of calls to EDGE may be used to force the
C presence of a set of edges defining the boundary of a non-
C convex and/or multiply connected region (refer to Subrou-
C tine ADDCST), or to introduce barriers into the triangula-
C tion.  Note that Subroutine GETNP will not necessarily
C return closest nodes if the triangulation has been con-
C strained by a call to EDGE.  However, this is appropriate
C in some applications, such as triangle-based interpolation
C on a nonconvex domain.
C
C
C On input:
C
C       IN1,IN2 = Indexes (of X and Y) in the range 1 to N
C                 defining a pair of nodes to be connected
C                 by an arc.
C
C       X,Y = Arrays of length N containing the Cartesian
C             coordinates of the nodes.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this routine.
C
C       LWK = Number of columns reserved for IWK.  This must
C             be at least NI -- the number of arcs which
C             intersect IN1-IN2.  (NI is bounded by N-3.)
C
C       IWK = Integer work array of length at least 2*LWK.
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND = Data structure defining the trian-
C                        gulation.  Refer to Subroutine
C                        TRMESH.
C
C On output:
C
C       LWK = Number of arcs which intersect IN1-IN2 (but
C             not more than the input value of LWK) unless
C             IER = 1 or IER = 3.  LWK = 0 if and only if
C             IN1 and IN2 were adjacent (or LWK=0) on input.
C
C       IWK = Array containing the indexes of the endpoints
C             of the new arcs other than IN1-IN2 unless IER
C             .GT. 0 or LWK = 0.  New arcs to the left of
C             IN2-IN1 are stored in the first K-1 columns
C             (left portion of IWK), column K contains
C             zeros, and new arcs to the right of IN2-IN1
C             occupy columns K+1,...,LWK.  (K can be deter-
C             mined by searching IWK for the zeros.)
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND = Data structure updated if necessary
C                        to reflect the presence of an arc
C                        connecting IN1 and IN2 unless IER
C                        .NE. 0.  The data structure has
C                        been altered if IER = 4.
C
C       IER = Error indicator:
C             IER = 0 if no errors were encountered.
C             IER = 1 if IN1 .LT. 1, IN2 .LT. 1, IN1 = IN2,
C                     or LWK .LT. 0 on input.
C             IER = 2 if more space is required in IWK.
C             IER = 3 if IN1 and IN2 could not be connected
C                     due to either an invalid data struc-
C                     ture or collinear nodes (and floating
C                     point error).
C             IER = 4 if an error flag was returned by
C                     OPTIM.

C   Given a triangulation of N nodes and an array NPTS con-
C taining the indexes of L-1 nodes ordered by distance from
C NPTS(1), this subroutine sets NPTS(L) to the index of the
C next node in the sequence -- the node, other than NPTS(1),
C ...,NPTS(L-1), which is closest to NPTS(1).  Thus, the
C ordered sequence of K closest nodes to N1 (including N1)
C may be determined by K-1 calls to GETNP with NPTS(1) = N1
C and L = 2,3,...,K for K .GE. 2.  Note that NPTS must in-
C clude constraint nodes as well as non-constraint nodes.
C Thus, a sequence of K1 closest non-constraint nodes to N1
C must be obtained as a subset of the closest K2 nodes to N1
C for some K2 .GE. K1.
C
C   The terms closest and distance have special definitions
C when constraint nodes are present in the triangulation.
C Nodes N1 and N2 are said to be visible from each other if
C and only if the line segment N1-N2 intersects no con-
C straint arc (except possibly itself) and is not an interi-
C or constraint arc (arc whose interior lies in a constraint
C region).  A path from N1 to N2 is an ordered sequence of
C nodes, with N1 first and N2 last, such that adjacent path
C elements are visible from each other.  The path length is
C the sum of the Euclidean distances between adjacent path
C nodes.  Finally, the distance from N1 to N2 is defined to
C be the length of the shortest path from N1 to N2.
C
C   The algorithm uses the property of a Delaunay triangula-
C tion that the K-th closest node to N1 is a neighbor of one
C of the K-1 closest nodes to N1.  With the definition of
C distance used here, this property holds when constraints
C are present as long as non-constraint arcs are locally
C optimal.

C            (defined above) between NPTS(1) and NPTS(I) in

C   Given a constrained Delaunay triangulation, this func-
C tion returns the index, if any, of an exterior constraint
C curve (an unbounded constraint region).  An exterior con-
C straint curve is assumed to be present if and only if the
C clockwise-ordered sequence of boundary nodes is a subse-
C quence of a constraint node sequence.  The triangulation
C adjacencies corresponding to constraint edges may or may
C not have been forced by a call to ADDCST, and the con-
C straint region may or may not be valid (contain no nodes).

C   Given a point P in the plane and a Delaunay triangula-
C tion created by Subroutine TRMESH or TRMSHR, this function
C returns the index of the nearest triangulation node to P.
C
C   The algorithm consists of implicitly adding P to the

C is based on the fact that, if P is a node in a Delaunay
C triangulation, the nearest node to P is a neighbor of P.

C   Given a set of NA triangulation arcs, this subroutine
C optimizes the portion of the triangulation consisting of
C the quadrilaterals (pairs of adjacent triangles) which
C have the arcs as diagonals by applying the circumcircle
C test and appropriate swaps to the arcs.

C   An iteration consists of applying the swap test and
C swaps to all NA arcs in the order in which they are
C stored.  The iteration is repeated until no swap occurs
C or NIT iterations have been performed.  The bound on the
C number of iterations may be necessary to prevent an

C   Given a triangulation of a set of points on the unit
C sphere, this subroutine replaces a diagonal arc in a
C strictly convex quadrilateral (defined by a pair of adja-
C cent triangles) with the other diagonal.  Equivalently, a
C pair of adjacent triangles is replaced by another pair
C having the same union.

C   This function applies the circumcircle test to a quadri-
C lateral defined by a pair of adjacent triangles.  The
C diagonal arc (shared triangle side) should be swapped for
C the other diagonl if and only if the fourth vertex is
C strictly interior to the circumcircle of one of the
C triangles (the decision is independent of the choice of
C triangle).  Equivalently, the diagonal is chosen to maxi-
C mize the smallest of the six interior angles over the two
C pairs of possible triangles (the decision is for no swap
C if the quadrilateral is not strictly convex).
C
C   When the four vertices are nearly cocircular (the
C neutral case), the preferred decision is no swap -- in
C order to avoid unnecessary swaps and, more important, to
C avoid cycling in Subroutine OPTIM which is called by
C DELNOD and EDGE.  Thus, a tolerance SWTOL (stored in
C SWPCOM by TRMESH or TRMSHR) is used to define 'nearness'
C to the neutral case.

C   This subroutine converts a triangulation data structure
C from the linked list created by Subroutine TRMESH or
C TRMSHR to a triangle list.
C
C On input:
C
C       NCC = Number of constraints.  NCC .GE. 0.
C
C       LCC = List of constraint curve starting indexes (or
C             dummy array of length 1 if NCC = 0).  Refer to
C             Subroutine ADDCST.
C
C       N = Number of nodes in the triangulation.  N .GE. 3.
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND = Linked list data structure defin-
C                        ing the triangulation.  Refer to
C                        Subroutine TRMESH.
C
C       NROW = Number of rows (entries per triangle) re-
C              served for the triangle list LTRI.  The value
C              must be 6 if only the vertex indexes and
C              neighboring triangle indexes are to be
C              stored, or 9 if arc indexes are also to be
C              assigned and stored.  Refer to LTRI.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this routine.
C
C       LTRI = Integer array of length at least NROW*NT,
C              where NT is at most 2N-5.  (A sufficient
C              length is 12N if NROW=6 or 18N if NROW=9.)
C
C       LCT = Integer array of length NCC or dummy array of
C             length 1 if NCC = 0.
C
C On output:
C
C       NT = Number of triangles in the triangulation unless
C            IER .NE. 0, in which case NT = 0.  NT = 2N - NB
C            - 2, where NB is the number of boundary nodes.
C
C       LTRI = NROW by NT array whose J-th column contains
C              the vertex nodal indexes (first three rows),
C              neighboring triangle indexes (second three
C              rows), and, if NROW = 9, arc indexes (last
C              three rows) associated with triangle J for
C              J = 1,...,NT.  The vertices are ordered
C              counterclockwise with the first vertex taken
C              to be the one with smallest index.  Thus,
C              LTRI(2,J) and LTRI(3,J) are larger than
C              LTRI(1,J) and index adjacent neighbors of
C              node LTRI(1,J).  For I = 1,2,3, LTRI(I+3,J)
C              and LTRI(I+6,J) index the triangle and arc,
C              respectively, which are opposite (not shared
C              by) node LTRI(I,J), with LTRI(I+3,J) = 0 if
C              LTRI(I+6,J) indexes a boundary arc.  Vertex
C              indexes range from 1 to N, triangle indexes
C              from 0 to NT, and, if included, arc indexes
C              from 1 to NA = NT+N-1.  The triangles are or-
C              dered on first (smallest) vertex indexes,
C              except that the sets of constraint triangles
C              (triangles contained in the closure of a con-
C              straint region) follow the non-constraint
C              triangles.
C
C       LCT = Array of length NCC containing the triangle
C             index of the first triangle of constraint J in
C             LCT(J).  Thus, the number of non-constraint
C             triangles is LCT(1)-1, and constraint J con-
C             tains LCT(J+1)-LCT(J) triangles, where
C             LCT(NCC+1) = NT+1.
C
C       IER = Error indicator.
C             IER = 0 if no errors were encountered.
C             IER = 1 if NCC, N, NROW, or an LCC entry is
C                     outside its valid range on input.
C             IER = 2 if the triangulation data structure
C                     (LIST,LPTR,LEND) is invalid.  Note,

C
C   This subroutine creates a Delaunay triangulation of a
C set of N arbitrarily distributed points in the plane re-
C ferred to as nodes.  The Delaunay triangulation is defined
C as a set of triangles with the following five properties:
C
C  1)  The triangle vertices are nodes.
C  2)  No triangle contains a node other than its vertices.
C  3)  The interiors of the triangles are pairwise disjoint.
C  4)  The union of triangles is the convex hull of the set
C        of nodes (the smallest convex set which contains
C        the nodes).
C  5)  The interior of the circumcircle of each triangle
C        contains no node.
C
C The first four properties define a triangulation, and the
C last property results in a triangulation which is as close
C as possible to equiangular in a certain sense and which is
C uniquely defined unless four or more nodes lie on a common
C circle.  This property makes the triangulation well-suited
C for solving closest point problems and for triangle-based
C interpolation.
C
C   The triangulation can be generalized to a constrained
C Delaunay triangulation by a call to Subroutine ADDCST.
C This allows for user-specified boundaries defining a non-
C convex and/or multiply connected region.
C
C   The algorithm for constructing the triangulation has
C expected time complexity O(N*log(N)) for most nodal dis-
C tributions.  Also, since the algorithm proceeds by adding
C nodes incrementally, the triangulation may be updated with
C the addition (or deletion) of a node very efficiently.
C The adjacency information representing the triangulation
C is stored as a linked list requiring approximately 13N
C storage locations.
C
C
C   The following is a list of the software package modules
C which a user may wish to call directly:
C
C  ADDCST - Generalizes the Delaunay triangulation to allow
C             for user-specified constraints.
C
C  ADDNOD - Updates the triangulation by appending or
C             inserting a new node.
C
C  AREAP  - Computes the area bounded by a closed polygonal
C             curve such as the boundary of the triangula-
C             tion or of a constraint region.
C
C  BNODES - Returns an array containing the indexes of the
C             boundary nodes in counterclockwise order.
C             Counts of boundary nodes, triangles, and arcs
C             are also returned.
C
C  CIRCUM - Computes the area, circumcenter, circumradius,
C             and, optionally, the aspect ratio of a trian-
C             gle defined by user-specified vertices.
C
C  DELARC - Deletes a boundary arc from the triangulation.
C
C  DELNOD - Updates the triangulation with the deletion of a
C             node.
C
C  EDGE   - Forces a pair of nodes to be connected by an arc
C             in the triangulation.
C
C  GETNP  - Determines the ordered sequence of L closest
C             nodes to a given node, along with the associ-
C             ated distances.  The distance between nodes is
C             taken to be the length of the shortest connec-
C             ting path which intersects no constraint
C             region.
C
C  INTSEC - Determines whether or not an arbitrary pair of
C             line segments share a common point.
C
C  JRAND  - Generates a uniformly distributed pseudo-random
C             integer.
C
C  LEFT   - Locates a point relative to a line.
C
C  NEARND - Returns the index of the nearest node to an
C             arbitrary point, along with its squared
C             distance.
C
C  STORE  - Forces a value to be stored in main memory so
C             that the precision of floating point numbers
C             in memory locations rather than registers is
C             computed.
C
C  TRLIST - Converts the triangulation data structure to a
C             triangle list more suitable for use in a fin-
C             ite element code.
C
C  TRLPRT - Prints the triangle list created by Subroutine
C             TRLIST.
C
C  TRMESH - Creates a Delaunay triangulation of a set of
C             nodes.
C
C  TRMSHR - Creates a Delaunay triangulation (more effici-
C             ently than TRMESH) of a set of nodes lying at
C             the vertices of a (possibly skewed) rectangu-
C             lar grid.
C
C  TRPLOT - Creates a level-2 Encapsulated Postscript (EPS)
C             file containing a triangulation plot.
C
C  TRPRNT - Prints the triangulation data structure and,
C             optionally, the nodal coordinates.
C
C
C On input:
C
C       N = Number of nodes in the triangulation.  N .GE. 3.
C
C       X,Y = Arrays of length N containing the Cartesian
C             coordinates of the nodes.  (X(K),Y(K)) is re-
C             ferred to as node K, and K is referred to as
C             a nodal index.  The first three nodes must not
C             be collinear.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this routine.
C
C       LIST,LPTR = Arrays of length at least 6N-12.
C
C       LEND = Array of length at least N.
C
C       NEAR,NEXT,DIST = Work space arrays of length at
C                        least N.  The space is used to
C                        efficiently determine the nearest
C                        triangulation node to each un-
C                        processed node for use by ADDNOD.
C
C On output:
C
C       LIST = Set of nodal indexes which, along with LPTR,
C              LEND, and LNEW, define the triangulation as a
C              set of N adjacency lists -- counterclockwise-
C              ordered sequences of neighboring nodes such
C              that the first and last neighbors of a bound-
C              ary node are boundary nodes (the first neigh-
C              bor of an interior node is arbitrary).  In
C              order to distinguish between interior and
C              boundary nodes, the last neighbor of each
C              boundary node is represented by the negative
C              of its index.
C
C       LPTR = Set of pointers (LIST indexes) in one-to-one
C              correspondence with the elements of LIST.
C              LIST(LPTR(I)) indexes the node which follows
C              LIST(I) in cyclical counterclockwise order
C              (the first neighbor follows the last neigh-
C              bor).
C
C       LEND = Set of pointers to adjacency lists.  LEND(K)
C              points to the last neighbor of node K for
C              K = 1,...,N.  Thus, LIST(LEND(K)) < 0 if and
C              only if K is a boundary node.
C
C       LNEW = Pointer to the first empty location in LIST
C              and LPTR (list length plus one).  LIST, LPTR,
C              LEND, and LNEW are not altered if IER < 0,
C              and are incomplete if IER > 0.
C
C       NEAR,NEXT,DIST = Garbage.
C
C       IER = Error indicator:
C             IER =  0 if no errors were encountered.
C             IER = -1 if N < 3 on input.
C             IER = -2 if the first three nodes are
C                      collinear.
C             IER = -4 if an error flag was returned by a
C                      call to SWAP in ADDNOD.  This is an
C                      internal error and should be reported
C                      to the programmer.
C             IER =  L if nodes L and M coincide for some
C                      M > L.  The linked list represents
C                      a triangulation of nodes 1 to M-1
C                      in this case.

C A nearest-node data structure (NEAR, NEXT, and DIST) is
C   used to obtain an expected-time (N*log(N)) incremental
C   algorithm by enabling constant search time for locating
C   each new node in the triangulation.
C
C For each unprocessed node K, NEAR(K) is the index of the
C   triangulation node closest to K (used as the starting
C   point for the search in Subroutine TRFIND) and DIST(K)
C   is an increasing function of the distance between nodes
C   K and NEAR(K).
C
C Since it is necessary to efficiently find the subset of
C   unprocessed nodes associated with each triangulation
C   node J (those that have J as their NEAR entries), the
C   subsets are stored in NEAR and NEXT as follows:  for
C   each node J in the triangulation, I = NEAR(J) is the
C   first unprocessed node in J's set (with I = 0 if the
C   set is empty), L = NEXT(I) (if I > 0) is the second,

C   tained as the data structure is updated.

C   This subroutine creates a Delaunay triangulation of a
C set of N nodes in the plane, where the nodes are the vert-
C ices of an NX by NY skewed rectangular grid with the
C natural ordering.  Thus, N = NX*NY, and the nodes are
C ordered from left to right beginning at the top row so
C that adjacent nodes have indexes which differ by 1 in the
C x-direction and by NX in the y-direction.  A skewed rec-
C tangular grid is defined as one in which each grid cell is
C a strictly convex quadrilateral (and is thus the convex
C hull of its four vertices).  Equivalently, any transfor-
C mation from a rectangle to a grid cell which is bilinear
C in both components has an invertible Jacobian.
C
C   If the nodes are not distributed and ordered as defined
C above, Subroutine TRMESH must be called in place of this
C routine.  Refer to Subroutine ADDCST for the treatment of
C constraints.
C
C   The first phase of the algorithm consists of construc-
C ting a triangulation by choosing a diagonal arc in each
C grid cell.  If NIT = 0, all diagonals connect lower left
C to upper right corners and no error checking or additional
C computation is performed.  Otherwise, each diagonal arc is
C chosen to be locally optimal, and boundary arcs are added
C where necessary in order to cover the convex hull of the
C nodes.  (This is the first iteration.)  If NIT > 1 and no
C error was detected, the triangulation is then optimized by
C a sequence of up to NIT-1 iterations in which interior
C arcs of the triangulation are tested and swapped if appro-
C priate.  The algorithm terminates when an iteration
C results in no swaps and/or when the allowable number of
C iterations has been performed.  NIT = 0 is sufficient to
C produce a Delaunay triangulation if the original grid is
C actually rectangular, and NIT = 1 is sufficient if it is
C close to rectangular.  Note, however, that the ordering
C and distribution of nodes is not checked for validity in
C the case NIT = 0, and the triangulation will not be valid
C unless the rectangular grid covers the convex hull of the
C nodes.

C On input:
C
C       N = Number of nodes in the grid.  N = NX*NY for some
C           NY .GE. 2.
C
C       NX = Number of grid points in the x-direction.  NX
C            .GE. 2.
C
C       X,Y = Arrays of length N containing coordinates of
C             the nodes with the ordering and distribution
C             defined in the header comments above.
C             (X(K),Y(K)) is referred to as node K.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this routine.
C
C       NIT = Nonnegative integer specifying the maximum
C             number of iterations to be employed.  Refer
C             to the header comments above.
C
C       LIST,LPTR = Arrays of length at least 6N-12.
C
C       LEND = Array of length at least N.

C On output:
C
C       NIT = Number of iterations employed.
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND,LNEW = Data structure defining the
C                             triangulation.  Refer to Sub-
C                             routine TRMESH.
C
C       IER = Error indicator:
C             IER = 0 if no errors were encountered.
C             IER = K if the grid element with upper left
C                     corner at node K is not a strictly
C                     convex quadrilateral.  The algorithm
C                     is terminated when the first such
C                     occurrence is detected.  Note that
C                     this test is not performed if NIT = 0
C                     on input.
C             IER = -1 if N, NX, or NIT is outside its valid
C                      range on input.
C             IER = -2 if NIT > 1 on input, and the optimi-
C                      zation loop failed to converge within
C                      the allowable number of iterations.
C                      The triangulation is valid but not
C                      optimal in this case.
