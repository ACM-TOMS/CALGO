To utilize the R\+I\+D\+C library, a main program should specify the \doxyref{O\+D\+E}{p.}{classODE} class, which specifies the system of O\+D\+Es to be solved, the \doxyref{O\+D\+E}{p.}{classODE} parameters (including the number of equations, number of time steps, size of the time step, and the initial and final time), as well as the step function\+: an Euler integerator that advances the solution from time t(n) to t(n+1). This step routine may be complicated requiring large scale linear algebra provided by external external libraries or possibly a nonlinear solve. The {\ttfamily examples/brusselator\+\_\+gsl} directory contains such an example. This example uses a backward Euler step for a nonlinear system of O\+D\+Es. The step function uses a Newton iteration (see the functions {\ttfamily newt} and {\ttfamily jac}) and the G\+N\+U scientific library (G\+S\+L) to solve for the Newton step. The functions {\ttfamily newt} and {\ttfamily jac} required by step are defined and declared in {\ttfamily brusselator.\+h}. Finally, the solution is integrated using a call to the {\ttfamily ridc\+\_\+fe} or {\ttfamily ridc\+\_\+be} functions.
