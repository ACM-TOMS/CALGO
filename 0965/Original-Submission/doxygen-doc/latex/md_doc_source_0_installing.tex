\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}

There are no prerequisites for building the base R\+I\+D\+C software and examples in {\ttfamily explicit/} and {\ttfamily implicit/}. To build the example in {\ttfamily brusselator\+\_\+gsl/}, the G\+N\+U Scientific Library and headers need to be installed. To build examples in {\ttfamily implicit\+\_\+mkl/}, {\ttfamily brusselator\+\_\+mkl/} and {\ttfamily brusselator\textbackslash{}\+\_\+radau\textbackslash{}\+\_\+mkl/}, the Intel Math Kernel Library needs to be installed, and appropriate environment variables initialized.

\paragraph*{Required}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A recent C++ compiler that supports (most of) the C++11 standard. This code has been successfully tested with G\+C\+C 4.\+1.\+x and the Intel Compiler 13.\+0.\+x.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Optional}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Intel M\+K\+L or G\+N\+U Scientific Library are required for some of the examples.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Obtain the Source Code}

The R\+I\+D\+C software is hosted at {\tt http\+://mathgeek.\+us/software.\+html}. Users should download the latest {\ttfamily libridc-\/x.\+x.\+tar.\+gz}, and uncompress the file to your desired location.

\subsubsection*{Configure the Software}

In the top level directory, {\ttfamily ./configure -\/-\/help} gives the possible configuration options. To configure using standard build configuration, type {\ttfamily ./configure -\/-\/prefix=/home/user/opt/libridc}. If you wish to compile and check the M\+K\+L and G\+S\+L examples, add the configuration flags {\ttfamily -\/-\/with-\/intel-\/mkl} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/with-\/gsl} respectively.

\subsubsection*{Building with Software}

The library is built by typing {\ttfamily make \&\& make check \&\& make install}. By default, only the explicit and implicit examples are part of make check, unless the {\ttfamily -\/-\/with-\/intel-\/mkl} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/with-\/gsl} flags are added in the configuration step.
