In 1992, Morgan, Sommese, and Wampler (<a href="#WMS">[WMS]</a>) provided  
a numerical proof that there are generically 1442 nondegenerate four-bar 
linkages whose coupler curve passes through nine prescribed points.   
Due to Roberts cognates and a two-fold symmetry, the resulting  
polynomial system generically has 8652 regular solutions. <br> 
 
&nbsp; &nbsp;  
Since we want the physically meaningful solutions to be real,  
we modified the polynomial system used by Morgan, Sommese, and Wampler. 
We first picked 9 random rational points in the complex plane and solved 
the resulting polynomial system with Bertini, which computed  
8652 regular solutions.  We used alphaCertified to certify that  
each of these points indeed correspond to distinct solutions. 
We then used a parameter homotopy in Bertini with these solutions as start points  
to compute the four-bar linkages for the specific set of 9 real points  
used by Morgan, Sommese, and Wampler in Problem 3 of <a href="#WMS">[WMS]</a>:

Using alphaCertified, we certified  
their result that 64 of the 1442 mechanisms are real. 
Three of these are shown the following animations, with the first one being 
the only viable mechanism. 
The remainder of this page documents these calculations,  
with directions on how to re-run our test 
and the files we used and created in the course of this test.  Additionally, 
we provide the scripts needed to generate the animations from the solutions.

<font size=+2><b>Solving Directions</b></font><br> 
 Before you begin, you will need to have  
 a working binary of Bertini and alphaCertified on your machine. 
<ul> 
 <li>Run Bertini with input file <a href="NinePt.bertini">NinePt.bertini</a> 
     which uses 9 random rational points in the complex plane.<br> 
 
      <font size=+1 color=magenta><tt>>: bertini NinePt.bertini</tt></font><br> 
     
      Using a single processor, this takes many hours.<br>   
      The output file of interest is  
      <a href="NinePt/nonsingular_solutions.bz2">nonsingular_solutions.bz2</a>, which is part of 
      the input for alphaCertified. 
      This is large, almost 10MB.
 </li> 
 <li>Use alphaCertified to certify that each point in  
      <a href="NinePt/nonsingular_solutions.bz2">nonsingular_solutions.bz2</a> corresponds to a distinct 
       solution.   
       <br> The file <a href="NinePt.poly">NinePt.poly</a> contains the polynomial 
       system and the configurations in <a href="settings">settings</a> tell alphaCertified to 
       utilize 256-bit precision.  
       We recommend capturing the output for perusal.<br>  
      
       <font size=+1 color=magenta><tt>>: alphaCertified NinePt.poly nonsingular_solutions settings > output</tt></font><br> 
 
       This takes a few minutes.   
 </li> 
 <li>Here is <a href="NinePt/output">output</a>.  Perusing it, we see that alphaCertified does certify that there are 8652 distinct solutions.  
 </li> 
 <li>Next, rename nonsingular_solutions as <a href="NinePtParam/start.bz2">start.bz2</a>.  These will be the start points for the  
      parameter homotopy used to solve the problem for a specific set of 9 real points.<br> 
 
       <font size=+1 color=magenta><tt>>: mv nonsingular_solutions start</tt></font><br> 
 
 <li>Use a parameter homotopy with Bertini described in <a href="NinePtParam.bertini">NinePtParam.bertini</a> 
       to compute the solutions for a specific set of 9 real points.<br> 
 
       <font size=+1 color=magenta><tt>>: bertini NinePtParam.bertini</tt></font><br> 
 
     This takes around an hour.<br> 
     The output file of interest is  
      <a href="NinePtParam/nonsingular_solutions.bz2">nonsingular_solutions.bz2</a>, which is part of 
      the input for alphaCertified. 
 </li> 
 <li>The last step is to use alphaCertified to certify that each point in  
      <a href="NinePtParam/nonsingular_solutions.bz2">nonsingular_solutions.bz2</a> corresponds
       to a distinct  
       solution and to verify that 384 are real.  <br>  
       The file <a href="NinePtReal.poly">NinePtReal.poly</a> contains the  
       polynomial system and the configurations in <a href="settings">settings</a> tell 
       alphaCertified to utilize 256-bit precision.  
       We recommend capturing the output for perusal.<br>  
      
     <font size=+1 color=magenta><tt>>: alphaCertified NinePtReal.poly nonsingular_solutions
     settings > output</tt></font><br>  
 
       This takes a few minutes.   
 </li> 
 <li>Here is <a href="NinePtParam/output">output</a>.  Perusing it, we see that alphaCertified
       does certify that there are  8652 distinct solutions and 384 (= 6 * 64) of them are real. 
 </li> 
 
 <li>Bertini and alphaCertified both create a halo of small files, which may be removed using 
     the short shell script <a href="scour.sh">scour.sh</a>.<br>  
 
     <font size=+1 color=magenta><tt>>: sh scour.sh</tt></font> 
 </li> 
</ul> 
 
Here is the bash session that ran this certification: 
<pre>>: bertini NinePt.bertini 
>: alphaCertified NinePt.poly nonsingular_solutions settings > output 
>: mv nonsingular_solutions start 
>: bertini NinePtParam.bertini 
>: alphaCertified NinePtReal.poly nonsingular_solutions settings > output 
>: sh scour.sh 
</pre>

<font size=+2><b>Animation directions</b></font><br> 
 Before you begin, you will need to have Maple (9.5 or later should be fine) on your machine.<br> 
 
 
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  
The file <a href="animate/RealSols.maple">RealSols.maple</a> contains the 384=6*64 real   
solutions that were computed and certified (using <a href="animate/grab.perl">grab.perl</a>, 
which parses the output of <tt>realDistinctSolns</tt>)  
in a list of Points for Maple consumption.  Each solution  
Point is a list of 12 components  
<center> 
 x1,&nbsp;x2,&nbsp;a1,&nbsp;a2,&nbsp;n1,&nbsp;n2,&nbsp; 
 y1,&nbsp;y2,&nbsp;b1,&nbsp;b2,&nbsp;m1,&nbsp;m2 
</center> 
where x = (x1,x2), a = (a1,a2), y = (y1,y2), b = (b1,b2)  
are drawn in Figure 1 of <a href="#WMS">[WMS]</a>, and n=(n1,n2) and m=(m1,m2) 
are auxiliary variables such that,  
<center> 
  n = a * conjugate(x)  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; and  &nbsp; &nbsp; m = b * conjugate(y), 
</center> 
as complex numbers.<br> 
 
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  
If (x,a,n,y,b,m) is a solution, then so is (y,b,m,x,a,n) 
as well as the four Robert's cognates which are given in  
Equation 17 of <a href="#WMS">[WMS]</a>. 
Each of these 6 solutions are listed in  
<a href="animate/RealSols.maple">RealSols.maple</a>.

 &nbsp; &nbsp;  
   Parametrizing a 4-bar linkage by points of  
<b>P</b><sup>1</sup> x <b>P</b><sup>1</sup>   
(rotations of two parallel bars), where the endpoints  
have distance equal to the length of the third bar, gives 
a bi-homogeneous curve of bi-degree (2,2) that parametrizes 
the positions of the linkage.    For a given four-bar  
linkage, we compute this curve and then parameterize it 
in two branches using the quadratic formula.  The real geometry 
of the curve affects our method of parametrizing, so  
we first sorted all linkages by the geometry of their (2,2)  
curves, and then drew each one, looking for appropriate 
pictures, which are reproduced (with animation) in the 
Maple files NUMBER.maple, avaible below.
