In order to install the Toolbox please do the following steps:

1) Copy the folder containing this file in the directory of your choice.
   If you change the name of the folder please do not put a name with
   space in it, for instance 'toolbox_JSR' and not 'toolbox JSR'.

2) Open Matlab, select File > Set Path...

   In the window that pops up, click on'Add with Subfolders...'

   Add the folder.
   In order not to re-do this at each start of Matlab
   click on button 'Save' before clicking on 'Close'.

   Manually you can use, in the command line,
     >> addpath <pathFolder>
   for this folder and its 4 subfolders (Benchmark, Methods, Pre-processing and Subroutines).
   In order to save this for further Matlab sessions type
     >> savepath

3) The Toolbox and its functions should now be available from any
 directory.
   From another directory, type
     >> help <nameOfFolder>
   if the names of all the functions are hyperlinks (in blue and underlined) it should have
   worked properly.

Notes:

- some functions require SeDuMi by default, it is easy to install and available at
  http://perso.uclouvain.be/raphael.jungers/sites/default/files/sedumi.zip
- The Toolbox has been tested on several OS's and Matlab versions, e.g., 
  Matlab R2007a Student, R2008a, R2010a(*) and R2012a.
  However, if you encounter any problem please contact us at jsr.louvain@gmail.com.

(*): on a Mac OS 10.7.5 64bits we encountered a problem with the SeDuMi mex-files that was 
     solved by re-generating them from their source with the install_sedumi.m script in
     Matlab.
