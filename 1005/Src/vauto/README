DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
After unzipping the directory structure of the package should be:

Directory               Contents
.../vauto               The main functions varma_llm, varma_llc, var_ll and
                        varma_sim; example_driver; demorun.m with associated
                        data file temperature.dat; this readme-file
.../vauto/private       Private subfunctions of the main functions
.../vauto/test          The test program suite
.../vauto/test/compare  Files for comparison with AS-311
.../vauto/doc           Documentation:
                          demorun.pdf with source code of demorun.m
                          demorunoutput.pdf with output from demorun.m
                          manuscripts submitted to TOMS on 26-Sep-2007 (2nd re-
                            submission, earlier submissions 20-08-06 & 29-03-07)

INSTALLATION
To use the package, add the root directory .../vauto to the Matlab search path
with either of the Matlab commands addpath (for temporary setting) or pathtool.

EXAMPLE DRIVER
The m-file example_driver.m demonstrates simple calls to the main functions.

DEMONSTRATION OF PARAMETER ESTIMATION
Install either Matlab's optimzation toolbox (which contains fminunc.m) or
immoptibox (which contains ucminf.m) available from http://imm.dtu.dk/~hbn.
Then run demorun('ucminf') or demorun('fminunc') as apropriate. 

TESTING
To carry out primary tests, that test the four main functions, cd into the
.../vauto/private directory, add .../vauto/test (as well as .../vauto) to the
Matlab search path and run TEST_PRIMARY. To include tests of the subfunctions,
run TEST_ALL. The reason that the private directory must be current for running
the tests is that it is not possible to add a folder named "private" to the
search path.

COMPARISON WITH AS311
Details of comparison with the algorithm AS-311 alias jam197.for (a previously
published program for complete data varma likelihood calculation) are given in
the subdirectory test/compare.
