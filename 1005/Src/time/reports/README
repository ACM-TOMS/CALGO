To create timing report:
1) Edit timepar.dat as required
2) Log on (remote) computer and run "time.sh < timepar.dat"
3) Back on the local computer, edit and then run getreports.sh, followed by:
     catreports.sh
     awk -v spread=0 -f consolidate.awk > report0.txt
     awk -v spread=1 -f consolidate.awk > report1.txt
report0.txt contains results for "repeated" runs and report1.txt for "spread" runs
(the file report1.txt is included as Table 1 in the accompanying published article).
NOTE that time.sh and getreports.sh assume that the blas-rmd root directory is ~/blas_rmd
