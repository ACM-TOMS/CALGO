This folder contains two example programs and associated supporting subroutines,
data files and test programs, as well as a Makefile:

   Main programs:
      demo1_driver.f90
      demo2_driver.f90

   Supporting subroutines:
      demo1_sumsq.f90
      demo2_likeli.f90
      dlyap.f90 (used by demo2)

   Test programs:
      test_demo1.f90
      test_demo2.f90
      test_dlyap.f90

   Data files:
      var_1_4.dat
      var_2_3.dat
      var_2_4.dat
      var_2_40.dat

   Files for timing demo2
      dlyap_slicot.f90 (gateway to sb03md.f)
      get_sb03md.sh (downloads the GNU-licensed sb03md from the web)
      timedemo2.sh (times demo 2 for a selection of parameters)

* To run the two demo programs (demo2 with var_2_3.dat), issue "makerun" either in
  this subfolder, or in the blas_rmd root folder (above this one).

* To run demo1 issue "./demo1_driver" in this folder.

* To see the options for running demo2 issue "./demo2_driver"

* To construct a new var_n_m file, one can use init_demo_var.m in the matlab
  folder.

* To check the correctness of the adjoints computed by demo1 and demo2 issue
  "make testdemo".

* To create a timing report for demo2, begin by obtaining sb03md.f with
  get_sb03md.sh and after that examine, possibly edit, and then run timedemo2.sh
