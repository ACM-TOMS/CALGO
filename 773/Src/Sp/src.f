C   Given data values and gradients at the three vertices of
C a spherical triangle containing a point P, this routine
C computes the value of F at P where F interpolates the ver-
C tex data.  Along the triangle sides, the interpolatory
C function F is the Hermite interpolatory tension spline
C defined by the values and tangential gradient components
C at the endpoints, and the gradient component normal to the
C triangle side varies linearly with respect to arc-length
C between the normal gradient components at the endpoints.
C A first-order C-1 blending method is used on the underly-
C ing planar triangle.  Since values and gradients on an arc
C depend only on the vertex data, the method results in C-1
C continuity when used to interpolate over a triangulation.
C
C   The blending method consists of taking F(P) to be a
C weighted sum of the values at PP of three univariate Her-
C mite interpolatory tension splines defined on the line
C segments which join the vertices to the opposite sides and
C pass through PP:  the central projection of P onto the
C underlying planar triangle.  The tension factors for these
C splines are obtained by linear interpolation between the
C pair of tension factors associated with the triangle sides
C which join at the appropriate vertex.
C
C   A tension factor SIGMA associated with a Hermite interp-
C olatory tension spline is a nonnegative parameter which
C determines the curviness of the spline.  SIGMA = 0 results
C in a cubic spline, and the spline approaches the linear
C interpolant as SIGMA increases.

C   Given a triangulation of a set of nodes on the unit
C sphere, along with data values H and gradients GRAD at the
C nodes, this subroutine determines, for each triangulation
C arc, the smallest (nonnegative) tension factor SIGMA such
C that the Hermite interpolatory tension spline H(A), de-
C fined by SIGMA and the endpoint values and directional
C derivatives, preserves local shape properties of the data.
C In order to define the shape properties on an arc, it is
C convenient to map the arc to an interval (A1,A2).  Then,
C denoting the endpoint data values by H1,H2 and the deriva-
C tives (tangential gradient components) by HP1,HP2, and
C letting S = (H2-H1)/(A2-A1), the data properties are
C
C       Monotonicity:  S, HP1, and HP2 are nonnegative or
C                        nonpositive,
C   and
C
C       Convexity:     HP1 .LE. S .LE. HP2  or  HP1 .GE. S
C                        .GE. HP2.
C
C The corresponding properties of H are constant sign of the
C first and second derivatives, respectively.  Note that,
C unless HP1 = S = HP2, infinite tension is required (and H
C is linear on the interval) if S = 0 in the case of mono-
C tonicity, or if HP1 = S or HP2 = S in the case of
C convexity.
C
C   Note that if gradients are to be computed by Subroutine
C GRADG or function values and gradients are computed by
C SMSURF, it may be desirable to alternate those computa-
C tions (which require tension factors) with calls to this
C subroutine.  This iterative procedure should terminate
C with a call to GETSIG in order to ensure that the shape
C properties are preserved, and convergence can be achieved
C (at the cost of optimality) by allowing only increases in
C tension factors (refer to the parameter descriptions for
C SIGMA, DSMAX, and IER).
C
C   Refer to functions SIG0, SIG1, and SIG2 for means of
C selecting minimum tension factors to preserve more general
C properties.

C On input:
C
C       N = Number of nodes in the triangulation.  N .GE. 3.
C
C       X,Y,Z = Arrays of length N containing the Cartesian
C               coordinates of the nodes.
C
C       H = Array of length N containing data values at the
C           nodes.  H(I) is associated with (X(I),Y(I),Z(I))
C           for I = 1,...,N.
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND = Data structure defining the tri-
C                        angulation.  Refer to STRIPACK
C                        Subroutine TRMESH.
C
C       GRAD = Array dimensioned 3 by N whose columns con-
C              tain gradients at the nodes.  GRAD( ,J) must
C              be orthogonal to node J:  GRAD(1,J)*X(J) +
C              GRAD(2,J)*Y(J) + GRAD(3,J)*Z(J) = 0..  Refer
C              to Subroutines GRADG, GRADL, and SMSURF.
C
C       TOL = Tolerance whose magnitude determines how close
C             each tension factor is to its optimal value
C             when nonzero finite tension is necessary and
C             sufficient to satisfy the constraint --
C             abs(TOL) is an upper bound on the magnitude
C             of the smallest (nonnegative) or largest (non-
C             positive) value of the first or second deriva-
C             tive of H in the interval.  Thus, the con-
C             straint is satisfied, but possibly with more
C             tension than necessary.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this routine.
C
C       SIGMA = Array of length 2*NA = 6*(N-1)-2*NB, where
C               NA and NB are the numbers of arcs and boun-
C               dary nodes, respectively, containing minimum
C               values of the tension factors.  The tension
C               factors are associated with arcs in one-to-
C               one correspondence with LIST entries.  Note
C               that each arc N1-N2 has two LIST entries and
C               thus, the tension factor is stored in both
C               SIGMA(I) and SIGMA(J) where LIST(I) = N2 (in
C               the adjacency list for N1) and LIST(J) = N1
C               (in the list associated with N2).  SIGMA
C               should be set to all zeros if minimal ten-
C               sion is desired, and should be unchanged
C               from a previous call in order to ensure con-
C               vergence of the iterative procedure describ-
C               ed in the header comments.

C       SIGMA = Array containing tension factors for which
C               H(A) preserves the local data properties on

C               that SIGMA(I) .LE. 85 for all I (unless the
C               input value is larger).  The factors are as
C               small as possible (within the tolerance) but
C               not less than their input values.  If infin-
C               ite tension is required on an arc, the cor-
C               responding factor is SIGMA(I) = 85 (and H
C               is an approximation to the linear inter-
C               polant on the arc), and if neither property
C               is satisfied by the data, then SIGMA(I) = 0

C   Given a triangulation of N nodes on the unit sphere with
C data values F at the nodes and tension factors SIGMA asso-
C ciated with the arcs, this routine uses a global method
C to compute estimated gradients at the nodes.  The method
C consists of minimizing a quadratic functional Q(G) over
C the N-vector G of gradients, where Q approximates the
C linearized curvature of the restriction to arcs of the
C interpolatory function F defined by Function FVAL.  The
C restriction of F to an arc of the triangulation is the
C Hermite interpolatory tension spline defined by the data
C values and tangential gradient components at the endpoints
C of the arc.  Letting D1F(A) and D2F(A) denote first and
C second derivatives of F with respect to a parameter A var-
C ying along a triangulation arc, Q is the sum of integrals
C over the arcs of D2F(A)**2 + ((SIGMA/L)*(D1F(A)-S))**2,
C where L denotes arc-length, SIGMA is the appropriate ten-
C sion factor, and S is the slope of the linear function of
C A which interpolates the values of F at the endpoints of
C the arc.
C
C   Since the gradient at node K lies in the plane tangent
C to the sphere surface at K, it is effectively defined by
C only two components -- its X and Y components in the coor-
C dinate system obtained by rotating K to the north pole.
C Thus, the minimization problem corresponds to an order-2N
C symmetric positive-definite sparse linear system which is
C solved by a block Gauss-Seidel method with 2 by 2 blocks.
C
C   An alternative method, Subroutine GRADL, computes a
C local approximation to the gradient at a single node and,
C although less efficient when all gradients are needed, was
C found to be generally more accurate (in the case of uni-
C form zero tension) when the nodal distribution is very
C dense, varies greatly, or does not cover the sphere.
C GRADG, on the other hand, was found to be slightly more
C accurate on a uniform distribution of 514 nodes.

C   Given a triangulation of a set of nodes on the unit
C sphere with their associated data values W, this routine
C estimates a gradient vector at node K as follows:  the
C coordinate system is rotated so that K becomes the north
C pole, node K and a set of nearby nodes are projected
C orthogonally onto the X-Y plane (in the new coordinate
C system), a quadratic is fitted in a weighted least squares
C sense to the data values at the projected nodes such that
C the value (associated with K) at (0,0) is interpolated, X
C and Y-partial derivative estimates DX and DY are computed
C by differentiating the quadratic at (0,0), and the esti-
C mated gradient G is obtained by rotating (DX,DY,0) back to
C the original coordinate system.  Note that G lies in the
C plane tangent to the sphere at node K, i.e., G is orthogo-
C nal to the unit vector represented by node K.  A Marquardt
C stabilization factor is used if necessary to ensure a
C well-conditioned least squares system, and a unique solu-
C tion exists unless the nodes are collinear.

C   Given a triangulation of a set of nodes on the unit
C sphere, along with an array of tension factors associated
C with the triangulation arcs, this subroutine prints the
C list of arcs (with tension factors) ordered by endpoint
C nodal indexes.  An arc is identified with its smaller
C endpoint index:  N1-N2, where N1 < N2.

C spline H(A), defined by SIG0 and the endpoint values and

C
C On input:
C
C       N1,N2 = Nodal indexes of the endpoints of an arc for
C               which the tension factor is to be computed.
C               The indexes must be distinct and lie in the
C               range 1 to N, and if IFLGS .GE. 1, they must
C               correspond to adjacent nodes in the triangu-
C               lation.

C       H = Array of length N containing data values at the

C              to Subroutines GRADG, GRADL, and SMSURF.

C       IFLGB = Bound option indicator:

C               IFLGB = 1 if HBND is an upper bound on H.

C              endpoints of the arc N1-N2.
C
C       TOL = Tolerance whose magnitude determines how close
C             SIG0 is to its optimal value when nonzero
C             finite tension is necessary and sufficient to
C             satisfy the constraint.  For a lower bound,
C             SIG0 is chosen so that HBND .LE. HMIN .LE.
C             HBND + abs(TOL), where HMIN is the minimum
C             value of H on the arc, and for an upper bound,

C             .LE. HMAX .LE. HBND.  Thus, the constraint is

C
C       IER = Error indicator:
C             IER = 0 if no errors were encountered and the

C   Given a triangulation of a set of nodes on the unit
C sphere, along with data values H and gradients GRAD at the
C nodes, this function determines the smallest tension fac-
C tor SIG1 such that the first derivative HP(A) of the
C Hermite interpolatory tension spline H(A), defined by SIG1
C and the endpoint values and directional derivatives asso-
C ciated with an arc N1-N2, is bounded (either above or
C below) by HPBND for all A in (A1,A2), where (A1,A2) de-
C notes an interval corresponding to the arc and A denotes
C arc-length.
C
C On input:
C
C       N1,N2 = Nodal indexes of the endpoints of an arc for
C               which the tension factor is to be computed.
C               The indexes must be distinct and lie in the
C               range 1 to N, and if IFLGS .GE. 1, they must
C               correspond to adjacent nodes in the triangu-
C               lation.
C
C       N = Number of nodes in the triangulation.  N .GE. 3.
C
C       X,Y,Z = Arrays of length N containing coordinates of
C               the nodes.  X(I)**2 + Y(I)**2 + Z(I)**2 = 1.
C
C       H = Array of length N containing data values at the
C           nodes.  H(I) is associated with (X(I),Y(I),Z(I))
C           for I = 1 to N.
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND = Data structure defining the trian-
C                        gulation.  Refer to STRIPACK
C                        Subroutine TRMESH.
C
C       GRAD = Array dimensioned 3 by N whose columns con-
C              gradients at the nodes.  GRAD( ,J) must be
C              orthogonal to node J:  GRAD(1,J)*X(J) +
C              GRAD(2,J)*Y(J) + GRAD(3,J)*Z(J) = 0.  Refer
C              to Subroutines GRADG, GRADL, and SMSURF.
C
C       IFLGB = Bound option indicator:
C               IFLGB = -1 if HPBND is a lower bound on HP.
C               IFLGB = 1 if HPBND is an upper bound on HP.
C
C       HPBND = Bound on HP.  HPBND .LE. min(HP1,HP2,S) if
C               IFLGB = -1 and HPBND .GE. max(HP1,HP2,S) if
C               IFLGB = 1, where HP1 and HP2 are the direc-
C               tional derivatives at the endpoints of the
C               arc N1-N2, and S is the slope of the linear
C               interpolant of the endpoint data values.
C
C       TOL = Tolerance whose magnitude determines how close
C             SIG1 is to its optimal value when nonzero
C             finite tension is necessary and sufficient to
C             satisfy the constraint.  For a lower bound,
C             SIG1 is chosen so that HPBND .LE. HPMIN .LE.
C             HPBND + abs(TOL), where HPMIN is the minimum
C             value of HP on the arc.  For an upper bound,
C             the maximum of HP satisfies HPBND - abs(TOL)
C             .LE. HPMAX .LE. HPBND.  Thus, the constraint
C             is satisfied but possibly with more tension
C             than necessary.
C
C       IFLGS = Tension array option indicator:
C               IFLGS .LE. 0 if SIGMA is not to be used.
C               IFLGS .GE. 1 if SIGMA is to be updated by
C                            storing SIG1 in the appropriate
C                            locations.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this function.
C
C       SIGMA = Dummy parameter (IFLGS .LE. 0) or array
C               containing tension factors associated with
C               arcs in one-to-one correspondence with LIST
C               entries (IFLGS .GE. 1).  Refer to Subroutine
C               GETSIG.
C
C On output:
C
C       SIGMA = Tension factor array updated with the new
C               value if and only if IFLGS .GE. 1 and IER
C               .GE. 0.
C
C       IER = Error indicator:
C             IER = 0 if no errors were encountered and the
C                     constraint can be satisfied with fin-
C                     ite tension.
C             IER = 1 if no errors were encountered but in-
C                     finite tension is required to satisfy
C                     the constraint (e.g., IFLGB = -1,
C                     HPBND = S, and HP1 > S).
C             IER = -1 if N1, N2, N, or IFLGB is outside its
C                      valid range.
C             IER = -2 if nodes N1 and N2 coincide or IFLGS
C                      .GE. 1 and the nodes are not adja-
C                      cent.
C             IER = -3 if HPBND is outside its valid range.
C
C       SIG1 = Minimum tension factor defined above unless
C              IER < 0, in which case SIG1 = -1.  If IER
C              = 1, SIG1 is set to 85, resulting in an
C              approximation to the linear interpolant of
C              the endpoint values.

C   Given a triangulation of a set of nodes on the unit
C sphere, along with data values H and gradients GRAD at the
C nodes, this function determines the smallest tension fac-
C tor SIG2 such that the Hermite interpolatory tension
C spline H(A), defined by SIG2 and the endpoint values and

C
C for all A in the open interval (A1,A2) corresponding to
C the arc, where HP1 and HP2 are the derivative values of H
C at the endpoints, S is the slope of the linear interpolant
C of the endpoint data values, HPP denotes the second deriv-
C ative of H, and A is arc-length.  Note, however, that
C infinite tension is required if HP1 = S or HP2 = S (unless
C HP1 = HP2 = S).
C
C On input:
C
C       N1,N2 = Nodal indexes of the endpoints of an arc for
C               which the tension factor is to be computed.
C               The indexes must be distinct and lie in the
C               range 1 to N, and if IFLGS .GE. 1, they must
C               correspond to adjacent nodes in the triangu-
C               lation.
C
C       N = Number of nodes in the triangulation.  N .GE. 3.
C
C       X,Y,Z = Arrays of length N containing coordinates of
C               the nodes.  X(I)**2 + Y(I)**2 + Z(I)**2 = 1.
C
C       H = Array of length N containing data values at the
C           nodes.  H(I) is associated with (X(I),Y(I),Z(I))
C           for I = 1 to N.
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND = Data structure defining the trian-
C                        gulation.  Refer to STRIPACK
C                        Subroutine TRMESH.
C
C       GRAD = Array dimensioned 3 by N whose columns con-
C              gradients at the nodes.  GRAD( ,J) must be
C              orthogonal to node J:  GRAD(1,J)*X(J) +
C              GRAD(2,J)*Y(J) + GRAD(3,J)*Z(J) = 0.  Refer
C              to Subroutines GRADG, GRADL, and SMSURF.
C
C       TOL = Tolerance whose magnitude determines how close
C             SIG2 is to its optimal value when nonzero
C             finite tension is necessary and sufficient to
C             satisfy convexity or concavity.  In the case
C             convexity, SIG2 is chosen so that 0 .LE.
C             HPPMIN .LE. abs(TOL), where HPPMIN is the
C             minimum value of HPP on the arc.  In the case
C             of concavity, the maximum value of HPP satis-
C             fies -abs(TOL) .LE. HPPMAX .LE. 0.  Thus, the
C             constraint is satisfied but possibly with more
C             tension than necessary.
C
C       IFLGS = Tension array option indicator:
C               IFLGS .LE. 0 if SIGMA is not to be used.
C               IFLGS .GE. 1 if SIGMA is to be updated by
C                            storing SIG2 in the appropriate
C                            locations.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this function.
C
C       SIGMA = Dummy parameter (IFLGS .LE. 0) or array
C               containing tension factors associated with
C               arcs in one-to-one correspondence with LIST
C               entries (IFLGS .GE. 1).  Refer to Subroutine

C
C       IER = Error indicator:
C             IER = 0 if no errors were encountered and fin-
C                     ite tension is sufficient to satisfy
C                     convexity (or concavity).

C                     finite tension is required to satisfy
C                     convexity.
C             IER = 2 if the data does not satisfy convexity
C                     or concavity.
C             IER = -1 if N1, N2, or N is outside its valid
C                      range.
C             IER = -2 if nodes N1 and N2 coincide or IFLGS
C                      .GE. 1 and the nodes are not adja-

C       SIG2 = Minimum tension factor defined above unless
C              IER < 0, in which case SIG2 = -1.  If IER
C              = 1, SIG2 is set to 85, resulting in an
C              approximation to the linear interpolant of
C              the endpoint values.  If IER = 2, SIG2 = 0,

C   This subroutine solves the symmetric positive definite
C linear system associated with minimizing the quadratic
C functional Q(F,FX,FY,FZ) described in Subroutine SMSURF.
C Since the gradient at node K lies in the plane tangent to
C the sphere surface at K, it is effectively defined by only
C two components -- its X and Y components in the coordinate
C system obtained by rotating K to the north pole.  Thus,
C the minimization problem corresponds to an order-3N system
C which is solved by the block Gauss-Seidel method with 3 by
C 3 blocks.

C   Given a triangulation of N nodes on the unit sphere with
C data values U at the nodes and tension factors SIGMA
C associated with the arcs, this routine determines a set of
C nodal function values F and gradients GRAD = (FX,FY,FZ)
C such that a quadratic functional Q1(F,GRAD) is minimized
C subject to the constraint Q2(F) .LE. SM for Q2(F) =
C (U-F)**T*W*(U-F), where W is a diagonal matrix of positive
C weights.  The functional Q1 is an approximation to the
C linearized curvature over the triangulation of a C-1 fun-
C ction F(V), V a unit vector, which interpolates the nodal
C values and gradients.  Subroutines INTRC1 and UNIF may be
C called to evaluate F at arbitrary points.
C
C   The smoothing procedure is an extension of the method
C for cubic spline smoothing due to C. Reinsch -- Numer.
C Math., 10 (1967) and 16 (1971).  Refer to Function FVAL
C for a further description of the interpolant F.  Letting
C D1F(T) and D2F(T) denote first and second derivatives of F
C with respect to a parameter T varying along a triangula-
C tion arc, Q1 is the sum of integrals over the arcs of
C D2F(T)**2 + ((SIGMA/L)*(D1F(T)-S))**2 where L denotes arc-
C length, SIGMA is the appropriate tension factor, and S is
C the slope of the linear function of T which interpolates
C the values of F at the endpoints of the arc.  Introducing
C a smoothing parameter P, and assuming the constraint is
C active, the problem is equivalent to minimizing Q(P,F,
C GRAD) = Q1(F,GRAD) + P*(Q2(F)-SM).  The secant method is
C used to find a zero of G(P) = 1/SQRT(Q2) - 1/SQRT(SM)
C where F(P) satisfies the order-3N symmetric positive def-
C inite linear system obtained by setting the gradient of Q
C (treated as a function of F and GRAD with GRAD tangent to
C the sphere surface) to zero.  The linear system is solved
C by the block Gauss-Seidel method (refer to SMSGS).
C
C   Note that the method can also be used to select grad-
C ients for the interpolation problem (F = U, SM = 0, and P
C infinite).  This is achieved by a call to Subroutine

C   Given a Delaunay triangulation of a set of nodes on the
C unit sphere, along with data values and tension factors
C associated with the triangulation arcs, this routine
C interpolates the data values to a uniform grid for such

C do not cover the entire sphere.
C
