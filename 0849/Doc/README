LDL Version 1.1: a sparse LDL' factorization and solve package.
    Written in C, with both a C and MATLAB mexFunction interface. 

These routines are not terrifically fast (they do not use dense matrix kernels),
but the code is very short and concise.  The purpose is to illustrate the
algorithms in a very concise and readable manner, primarily for educational
purposes.  Although the code is very concise, this package is slightly faster
than the built-in sparse Cholesky factorization in MATLAB 6.5 (chol), when
using the same input permutation.

Quick start (Unix, or Windows with Cygwin):

    To compile, test, and install LDL, you may wish to first obtain a copy of
    AMD from http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse, and place it in the
    ../AMD directory, relative to this directory.  Next, type "make", which
    will compile the LDL library and three demo main programs (one of which
    requires AMD).  It will also compile the LDL MATLAB mexFunction (if you
    have MATLAB).  Typing "make clean" will remove non-essential files.

Quick start (for MATLAB users);

    To compile, test, and install the LDL mexFunction, start MATLAB in this
    directory and type ldldemo and/or ldltest.  This works on any system
    supported by MATLAB.
