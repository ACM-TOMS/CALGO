<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> SPRNG Installation </H1> 
 
<DL> 
 
<DT> <STRONG>After Obtaining SPRNG source code:</STRONG> 
<P> 
<LI>Change directory to the <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> directory. For example: 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<KBD>cd sprng</KBD> 
<P> 
 
<DT><STRONG>SPRNG organization</STRONG> 
<P> 
<DD>The main SPRNG directory, <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>, contains the 
following subdirectories:<BR><BR>  
<OL> 
<LI> <SAMP>SRC</SAMP> contains the source code for 
the SPRNG libraries. The code for each generator is in a separate 
subdirectory. Code common to all the generators is in the SRC 
directory itself. 
<LI> <SAMP>EXAMPLES</SAMP> contains example 
C and FORTRAN programs that demonstrate the use of the SPRNG libraries. 
<LI> <SAMP>DOCS</SAMP> contains SPRNG documentations as a compressed
tar file of several html documents. Please uncompress and untar them
and see the toc.html file for the rest of the links. The <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Apps/SPRNG">SPRNG home
page</a> has links to the updated version of this documentation.
<LI> <SAMP>TESTS</SAMP> contains source code for 
routines that test the quality of the random number generators. 
<LI> <SAMP>lib</SAMP> The SPRNG random number libraries will be placed
here by default when you compile them. 
<LI> <SAMP>include</SAMP> The SPRNG header files are located here. 
</OL> 
<P> 
 
<DT><STRONG>Building the SPRNG 
libraries</STRONG> 
<P> 
 
<DD> In order to build the SPRNG libraries, the example programs and 
the executables that test the quality of the random number generators, please edit the file <KBD>make.CHOICES</KBD><BR> 
<P>The <SAMP>make.CHOICES</SAMP> file looks like this: 
<P> 
<PRE> 
#PLAT = CONVEX 
PLAT = SGI 
#PLAT = SP2 
#PLAT = T3E 
</PRE> 
<P> 
If users wish to build SPRNG on the HP/Convex Exemplar, then they 
should comment out the line specifying the SGI and uncomment 
the line specifying the CONVEX as follows: 
<P> 
<PRE> 
PLAT = CONVEX 
#PLAT = SGI 
#PLAT = SP2 
#PLAT = T3E 
</PRE> 
<P> 
Then, the <SAMP>make</SAMP> command will build the libraries using the  
compiler options set in the file <SAMP>SRC/make.CONVEX</SAMP>.  The user 
may wish to edit this file if a different compiler or different compiler  
options are wanted. In particular, if a FORTRAN 77 compiler or ranlib is not available, please set F77 or RANLIB to 'echo' respectively. 
 
 
<P>Currently SPRNG has been tested on <A 
HREF="platforms.html#t3e">CRAY T3E</A>, <A HREF="platforms.html#exemplar">HP/CONVEX 
Exemplar</A>, <A HREF="platforms.html#sp2">IBM SP2</A>, <A 
HREF="platforms.html#origin2000">SGI-CRAY Origin 2000</A> and <A 
HREF="platforms.html#power-challenge">SGI Power  
Challenge</A> parallel computers. It has also been ported to <A 
HREF="platforms.html#hp">HP</A> and <A 
HREF="platforms.html#sun">SUN</A> workstations and PC running <A
HREF="platforms.html#linux">Linux</A>. Please read the notes on the <A 
HREF="makefile.html">makefile</A> to port SPRNG to other machines.
 
<P> 
 
Alternatively, the subdirectories can be built individually by executing the 
<KBD>make</KBD> command 
in the desired subdirectory. 
 
<P> 
The compilation process includes a file called 
<SAMP>make.</SAMP><VAR>platform</VAR>, depending on the platform. We have set certain variables 
based on their setting on our systems. If they differ on 
your system, please see our explanation for the <A 
HREF="makefile.html">makefile</A> and make suitable changes. 
 
<P> 
 By 
default, the SPRNG libraries are placed in the <SAMP>lib</SAMP> sub-directory. Along with the libraries, certain executables for 
timing the generators and for checking whether the generators ported 
correctly placed in the main <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> directory. 
<P> 
 
<DT><STRONG>Checking the 
libraries</STRONG> 
<P> 
 
<DD> Once the SPRNG library has been built, the user should <A HREF="checksprng.html">check</A> that 
the library has indeed ported correctly. Please execute the following 
command in the directory <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>:<BR> 
<BR> 
<KBD>./checksprng</KBD><BR> 
<BR> 
The output will give the results for the different SPRNG libraries and 
interfaces. All the tests should be <EM>PASSED</EM>. If any of the 
test <EM>FAILS</EM>, then SPRNG has not ported correctly. Please 
<A HREF="mailto:ashoks@ncsa.uiuc.edu">report</A> this problem to us. 
<P> 
 
<DT> <STRONG>Timing the libraries</STRONG> 
<P> 
<DD> The user can check the <A HREF="timesprng.html">speed</A> of the different SPRNG random number 
generators by executing the following 
command in the directory <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>:<BR> 
<BR> 
<KBD>./timesprng</KBD><BR> 
<BR> 
The output will give the time taken for generating a million random 
numbers, and also the number of random numbers generated per second, 
expressed in MRS (Million Random numbers per Second).
