<P> 
Let us consider the following experiment to verify the randomness of an 
infinite sequence of integers in [1,<I>d</I>].  Suppose we  
let you view as many numbers from the sequence as you wished to. You 
should then guess any other number in the sequence. If the likelihood 
of your guess being correct is greater than 1/<I>d</I>, then the 
sequence is not random.   
In practice, to estimate the winning probabilities 
we must play this guessing game several times. 
<P> 
This test has certain implications, the most important of which is the 
uniformity of the individual elements.  If the sequence consists of 
integers in [1,<I>d</I>], then the probability of getting any particular 
integer should be 1/<I>d</I>. 
All good sequences are constructed to have this 
property. But  applications in statistical mechanics 
as well as other real applications rely heavily on uniformity in 
higher dimensions, at least 4 dimensions if not thousands. 
<P> 
We define uniformity in higher 
dimensions as follows. Suppose we define n-tuples <IMG WIDTH=146 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1361" SRC="img9.gif"> and divide the <I>n</I>-dimensional unit hypercube into many 
equal sub-volumes.  A sequence is uniform if in the limit of an 
infinite sequence all the sub-volumes have an equal number of 
occurrences of random n-tuples. For a random sequence this will be 
true for <I>all</I> values of <I>n</I> and all partitions into subvolumes,  
though in practice we only test for small values of <I>n</I>. 
<P> 
The following simple Metropolis Monte Carlo example demonstrates how 
correlations between successive pairs of random numbers can give 
incorrect results.  Suppose we sample the movement of a particle along 
the <I>x</I> axis confined in a potential well which is symmetric about the 
origin: <I>V</I>(<I>x</I>)=<I>V</I>(-<I>x</I>).  The classic Metropolis algorithm is outlined in 
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#moveparticle"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="./cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>. At each step in our calculations, the 
particle is moved to a trial position with the first random number 
(<I>sprng() </I>) and then that step is accepted or rejected with the 
second random number. 
<P> 
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#randomwalk"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="./cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows the results of the particle density 
computed exactly (for a harmonic well) with a good random number 
sequence, and also with sequences which are deliberately chosen to be 
correlated or anti-correlated. In the latter case a high number is 
likely to be followed by a low number and a low number by a high 
number. The particle density is then not symmetric because movements 
to the right are more likely to be rejected than movements to the 
left, so that the final distribution is skewed.  This occurs despite 
uniformity of the individual elements of the sequence.

<P> 
Now let us imagine how this changes for <I>N</I> particles in three 
dimensions. The usual Metropolis MC algorithm for a simple classical 
fluid will use random numbers four at a time (three for the 
displacement and one for the acceptance test) so that the algorithm is 
potentially sensitive to correlations between successive quadruples of 
numbers.  But it can also be sensitive to correlations of <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1383" SRC="img12.gif"> with 
<IMG WIDTH=44 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1385" SRC="img13.gif"> since one usually goes through the particles in order, 
causing <IMG WIDTH=89 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1387" SRC="img14.gif"> to be used for the same purpose on the 
same particle. Unfortunately, the usual linear congruential generator 
has correlations between numbers separated by distances that are  
powers of 2; so it is not a good idea to simulate systems where <I>N</I> is 
a power of 2 with this generator.  In general each Monte Carlo 
algorithm is sensitive to particular types of correlations, making it 
hard to define a universal test.
