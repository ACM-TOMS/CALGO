A pseudo random number generator is a finite state 
machine with at most  <IMG WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1405" SRC="img20.gif"> different states where <I>p</I> is the number of  
bits that represent the state.  
One can easily see that the 
sequence must repeat after at most <IMG WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1405" SRC="img20.gif"> different 
numbers have been generated. The smallest number of steps after which 
the generator starts repeating itself is called the <I>period</I> or cycle length, 
<I>L</I>. 
Assuming all cycles have the same length, the number of disjoint cycles  
(i.e. having no states in common) is then: <IMG WIDTH=35 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1413" SRC="img21.gif">. 
<P> 
A computer in 1997 might deliver <IMG WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1415" SRC="img22.gif"> numbers/processor/ second (or 
<IMG WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1417" SRC="img23.gif">). Hence it will take 1 second to exhaust a generator with a 
26 bit internal state and 1 year to exhaust one with <IMG WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline1419" SRC="img24.gif"> internal 
states. This suggests that it could be dangerous to use the 32 bit 
generators developed for the microprocessors of the 1980's on today's 
computers. 
After the sequence is exhausted, the ``true'' error  of a simple MC  
evaluation integral will no longer decrease and one can be mislead into 
trusting an incorrect answer. 
<P> 
However, for many applications a small period will not in itself bias 
the results significantly. For example in MCMC we can think of the 
``state'' of the random walk as consisting both of the coordinates of 
the particles (say 3<I>N</I> position variables) and of the internal state of the  PRNG. 
The walk will repeat itself only if all the 
coordinates are exactly the same.  Hence even if the random number 
sequence repeats, the particles will have moved on and have a 
different internal state.  
However, it is not a good idea to have repeating sequences, 
especially since it is easy to avoid.
