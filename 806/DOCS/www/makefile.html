<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>  SPRNG Makefiles </H1> 
 
<P>
The following information may help you port SPRNG to your machine.

<H2>Platform dependent compilation</H2> 
 
There is a file included in the  SPRNG distribution called 
<SAMP>make.CHOICES</SAMP> which sets the platform for compilation. 
Once this file is properly edited, the user can build the SPRNG libraries  
by simply using the <SAMP>make</SAMP> command.  
 
<P>The <SAMP>make.CHOICES</SAMP> file looks like this: 
<P> 
<PRE> 
#PLAT = CONVEX 
PLAT = SGI 
#PLAT = SP2 
#PLAT = T3E 
</PRE> 
<P> 
If users wish to build SPRNG on the HP/Convex Exemplar, then they 
should comment out the line specifying the SGI and uncomment 
the line specifying the CONVEX as follows: 
<P> 
<PRE> 
PLAT = CONVEX 
#PLAT = SGI 
#PLAT = SP2 
#PLAT = T3E 
</PRE> 
<P> 
Then, the <SAMP>make</SAMP> command will build the libraries using the  
compiler options set in the file <SAMP>SRC/make.CONVEX</SAMP>   The user 
may wish to edit this file if a different compiler or different compiler  
options are wanted. 
<P> 
<H2>Variables in the Make.<EM>PLAT</EM></H2> 
We shall next describe the different variables defined in the 
<SAMP>make.</SAMP><VAR>platform</VAR> files. The makefile includes
information from this file in order to determine the values of certain
variables. We take as an example <A 
HREF="platforms.html">platform</A> the <SAMP>make.SGI</SAMP> for use in an 
SGI Power Challenge. The relevant portion of the file is as follows: 
<P> 
<PRE> 
AR = ar 
ARFLAGS = cr 
#If your system does not have ranlib, then replace next statement with  
#RANLIB = echo 
RANLIB = ranlib 
CC = cc 
CLD = $(CC) 
F77 = f77 
F77LD = $(F77) 
FFXN = -DAdd_ 
# 64 bit compilation 
# 
# To use MPI, set the MPIDIR to location of mpi library, and MPILIB  
# to name of mpi library. Remove # signs from beginning of next 3 lines. 
# Also, if the previous compilation was without MPI, type: make realclean 
# before compiling for mpi. 
# 
MPIDEF = -DSPRNG_MPI #Only if you plan to use MPI 
MPIDIR = -L/usr/lib64 
MPILIB = -lmpi 
# 
CFLAGS = -O2 -D$(PLAT) $(MPIDEF) -D_LONG_LONG -align64 -64   
CLDFLAGS =  -align64 -64 # 64 bit compilation 
FFLAGS = -O2 -align64   $(MPIDEF)  -DPOINTER_SIZE=8 -D_LONG_LONG -64  #64 bit compilation 
F77LDFLAGS =  -align64 -64 # 64 bit compilation 
CPP = gcc -E -P   $(MPIDEF)  -DPOINTER_SIZE=8 -D_LONG_LONG # 64 bit compilation 
INLINEOPT = -INLINE:must=get_rn_int,get_rn_dbl,get_rn_flt,get_rn_int_simple,get_rn_flt_simple,get_rn_dbl_simple 
</PRE> 
<P> 
<H3>Descriptions of variables</H3> 
<SAMP>AR</SAMP> is the command to archive the library. 
<P> 
<SAMP>ARFLAGS</SAMP> is the flag to the archiver. Here we  
create the library or replace the object files already archived. 
<P> 
<SAMP>RANLIB</SAMP> is essentially used to generate the table of 
contents to the library. You can set this to "echo" if ranlib is not
available on your machine. 
<P> 
<SAMP>CC</SAMP> and <SAMP>CLD</SAMP> are the C compiler and loader 
respectively. 
<P> 
<SAMP>F77</SAMP> and <SAMP>F77LD</SAMP> are the FORTRAN77 compiler and loader 
respectively. If they are not avaiable, then set them to 'echo'. 
<P> 
<SAMP>FFXN</SAMP> is needed for the following reason. SPRNG is written 
in C. FORTRAN wrappers are also available, which provide an interface 
to FORTRAN users. These wrappers are actually C functions. When a 
FORTRAN user calls a wrapper function <VAR>fxn</VAR>, FORTRAN compilers often 
change the name to something else, for example 
<VAR>fxn</VAR><SAMP>_</SAMP>. Thus the wrappers should also have their 
function names modified the same way. The flag <SAMP>FFXN</SAMP> 
ensures that the correct modification is made to the wrapper function 
names during SPRNG installation. You can ignore FFXN if you do
not wish to get a FORTRAN interface, and have set F77 to "echo".

<P> 
<SAMP>CFLAGS</SAMP> and <SAMP>CLDFLAGS</SAMP> are the flags to the C compiler and loader 
respectively. 
<P> 
<SAMP>FFLAGS</SAMP> and <SAMP>F77LDFLAGS</SAMP> are the  flags to the 
FORTRAN77 compiler and loader respectively. 
<P> 
<SAMP>CPP</SAMP> is provided for the sake of those FORTRAN compilers 
which are not capable of calling the C <A 
HREF="definitions.html#preprocess">preprocessor</A>. SPRNG executables and 
example programs in FORTRAN have names of the form 
<VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.F</SAMP>, and involve preprocessing 
directives. If some compiler cannot accept such a file, then 
we preprocess the file using the command: 
<P> 
 <VAR>CPP </VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.F  </SAMP> 
<P> 
The 
 resulting file is called either 
<VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.f</SAMP> or 
<VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.i</SAMP>. In the latter case, the user 
should move it to a file called  <VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.f</SAMP> by 
issuing the following command: 
<P> 
<KBD>mv</KBD> <VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.i</SAMP> <VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.f</SAMP>   
<P> 
<VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.f</SAMP> can be processed by the user's 
FORTRAN compiler. You can ignore this if your FORTRAN compiler can
invoke the preprocessor itself, or if you do not wish to compile FORTRAN
programs.

<P> 
<SAMP>MPIDEF</SAMP> should be set to <SAMP>-DSPRNG_MPI</SAMP> if the 
user is installing the <A HREF="message-passing.html#mpi">MPI</A> 
version of SPRNG. This line should be commented out, by appending a # 
sign, or removed otherwise. This flag causes a <A 
HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> called 
<SAMP>SPRNG_MPI</SAMP> to be defined in the SPRNG code, which enables 
calls to MPI functions. 
<P> 
<SAMP>MPIDIR</SAMP> indicates the path to the MPI library. 
<P> 
<SAMP>MPILIB</SAMP> indicates the name of the MPI library. 
<P> 
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> <SAMP>MPIDEF</SAMP>, <SAMP>MPIDIR</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>MPILIB</SAMP> should be commented out or removed if the user 
does not wish to install the MPI version of SPRNG. 
<P> 
Users may wish to use the above variables and flags in compiling their programs 
too. However, the flags <SAMP>-DSPRNG_MPI</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>-D_LONG_LONG</SAMP>, and the variables <SAMP>MPIDEF</SAMP> and <SAMP>FFXN</SAMP> are needed only 
during the SPRNG installation. Users can take a look at the Makefile 
in the EXAMPLES directory in order to see some compilation flags that 
they might wish to use. 
 
<P> 
The flag <SAMP>-DPOINTERSIZE=8</SAMP> indicates that the size of the 
pointer is 8 bytes. The default value assumed by SPRNG is 4 
bytes. You must set this to the <SAMP>8</SAMP> if your machine has
8-bit pointers.
 
<P> 
<SAMP>INLINEOPT</SAMP> gives compiler options to inline certain
functions, in order to improve efficiency. You can ignore this if you
are not that concerned about efficiency.
 
<P> 
<H2>Porting SPRNG to new machines</H2> 
 
 Please set the <SAMP>PLAT</SAMP> variable in
 <SAMP>make.CHOICES</SAMP> to <SAMP>GENERIC</SAMP> and edit the
 <SAMP>make.GENERIC</SAMP> to suit your system, after reading the
 explanations above. Little Endian machines may need the option:
 <SAMP>-DLittleEndian</SAMP> added to CFLAGS.

 In order to optimize the performance, please try the following: (i)
 Add <SAMP>-D_LONG_LONG</SAMP> to CFLAGS and/or(ii) Add
 <SAMP>-DGENERIC</SAMP> to CFLAGS. If <SAMP>checksprng</SAMP> passes,
 then SPRNG is installed correctly. If not, please remove whichever
 option caused SPRNG to fail and recompile.
