<DL> 
<A NAME="checkpoint"></A> 
<DT><STRONG> Check-Pointing</STRONG> 
<P> 
<DD> Users may sometimes wish to save the <A 
HREF="#state"><EM>states</EM></A> of random number <A 
HREF="#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> into a file. This is typically done 
for the following two reasons:  
 
<P> 
<OL> 
<LI>In case the system the user is 
working on is unreliable, the user may want to save the state of the 
calculations into a file, once in a while. If the system crashes, then 
the user can recover the state of the calculations from the file and 
continue from that point onwards, instead of repeating the entire 
calculations.  
 
<P> 
<LI>Users may not wish to perform the entire 
calculations all at one time. This may either be because they are not 
sure if the calculations are worth continuing until they have obtained 
some intermediate results, or because system time is less expensive 
during certain times of the day. In the latter case they may perform 
the calculations every day during such cheaper periods. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
In both the cases mentioned above, users will need to store the 
states of random number streams so that they can start  
 from where they had left off the previous time. SPRNG 
provides a function that returns the state of a random number stream 
as an array of characters. Users can store this array into a 
file. They can later read the stored information back into a character 
array. SPRNG provides a function to obtain the saved state of the 
random number stream from this character array, thus enabling users to 
continue with their calculations. 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="examples/description.html#checkpoint">Example</A><BR> 
<P> 
 
 
<A NAME="header"></A> 
<DT> <STRONG> Header Files</STRONG> 
<P> 
<DD> The actual names of the SPRNG functions differ from those given in 
the SPRNG <A HREF="usage.html#interfaces">interface</A> 
descriptions. We have <A HREF="macros.html">defined</A> certain <A 
HREF="#macros"><EM>macros</EM></A> in the files <A 
HREF="sprng.html#sprng">sprng.h</A> and <A 
HREF="sprng.html#sprngf">sprng_f.h</A>. If the users <A 
HREF="#include"><EM>include</EM></A> either of those 
files (the former file by C users and the latter by FORTRAN users) 
in their program, then the correct SPRNG function is automatically 
called.  
<P> 
<A NAME="preprocess"></A>  
<STRONG>Note to FORTRAN users on preprocessor directives:</STRONG> The header files contain 
preprocessing directives which most modern FORTRAN compilers are able 
to handle. These compilers typically require special flags and/or the 
filename to end in <SAMP>.F</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>.f</SAMP> in order 
to preprocess these directives. In case the latter case, users should copy files containing C preprocessor directives to a file with an extension of </SAMP>.F</SAMP>. The user's makefile may need to be changed to give instructions for handling these new files.  
 
<P> 
Those who are not familiar with the 'make' command can try adding the following lines to their makefile, instead of making any other change: 
 
<CODE> 
<PRE> 
.SUFFIXES : .f .F 
 
.F.f :  
	@if [ -f $*.i ] ; then \ 
	rm $*.i ;\ 
	fi 
	$(CPP) -I$(SRCDIR) $*.F 
	@if [ -f $*.i ] ; then \ 
	mv $*.i  $*.f ;\ 
	fi 
</PRE> 
</CODE> 
Where $(CPP) is identical to that given in the <SAMP>sprng/SRC/make.</SAMP><VAR>PLAT</VAR> file, where PLAT is the user's platform, and $(SRCDIR) is the SPRNG source directory. This same technique can be used in case the user's FORTRAN compiler 
does not call the preprocessor. This creates a regular FORTRAN file which the compiler can handle. 
<P> 
On the IBM SP2, please use the following code instead of that given above: 
<CODE> 
<PRE> 
.SUFFIXES : .f .F 
 
.F.f:  
        $(CPP) -WF,-I$(SRCDIR) $*.F 
        @if [ -f F$*.f ] ; then \ 
        mv F$*.f  $*.f ;\ 
</PRE> 
</CODE> 
 
 
<A NAME="include"></A> 
<DT> <STRONG> Including Header Files</STRONG> 
<P> <DD> A C user needs to include the <A 
HREF="#header"><EM>header file</EM></A>  
<A HREF="sprng.html#sprng"><SAMP>sprng.h</SAMP></A> and a FORTRAN user 
 <A HREF="sprng.html#sprngf"><SAMP>sprng_f.h</SAMP></A> in order to 
 use SPRNG. For example, FORTRAN users would type: 
<P> 
<SAMP>#include "sprng_f.h"</SAMP> 
<P> 
in their FORTRAN program files that make SPRNG calls. This statement causes 
the contents of the file <SAMP>sprng_f.h</SAMP> to appear instead of 
the statement <SAMP>#include "sprng_f.h"</SAMP> once the file has been 
preprocessed. This usage is demonstrated in the following examples: 
<P> 
<A HREF="examples/description.html#checkpoint">C Example</A><BR> 
<P> 
FORTRAN users can also read the note on <A 
HREF="definitions.html#header"><EM>header files</EM></A>  if they are 
not used to the C preprocessor. 
<P> 
 
<A NAME="independence"></A> 
<DT> <STRONG> Independence of Random Number Streams</STRONG> 
<P> <DD> Users will generally use several random number <A 
HREF="#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> in their 
calculations. It is important for these streams to be uncorrelated, 
in order for the pseudorandom numbers to be effective at the desired 
variance reduction, which is, of course, the point of large Monte 
Carlo calculations. We refer to this property of streams being 
uncorrelated as the <EM>independence</EM> of streams. SPRNG provides random number streams that have been 
tested for their independence. 
<P> 
 
 
<A NAME="initialize"></A> 
<DT> <STRONG>Initialization of Streams</STRONG> 
<P> <DD> We store the <A 
HREF="#state"><EM>state</EM></A>  of a random number <A 
HREF="#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A> in some memory 
location. Before we do this, it is necessary to allocate memory space. We then determine the initial state of the stream from the <A 
HREF="#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> and other parameters of 
the generator. This process is known as <EM>initialization</EM>. Before a 
random number stream can be used, an initialization call has to be 
made. Usually the users need to call <SAMP>init_sprng</SAMP> to perform 
the initialization. The exceptions are (i) in the simple interface where 
default initialization is performed under certain conditions, (ii) 
when the <SAMP>unpack_sprng</SAMP> function is used that creates a 
stream with an appropriate state and (iii) when the user calls 
<SAMP>spawn_sprng</SAMP>, which performs the initialization itself. 
<P> 
 
<A NAME="locality"></A> 
<DT> <STRONG>Locality</STRONG> 
<P> <DD> By <EM>locality</EM> we mean that an operation performed on a 
<A HREF="#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A>  should not involve communication between processors. For 
example, when we <A 
HREF="#initialize"><EM>initialize</EM></A>  or <A 
HREF="#spawn"><EM>spawn</EM></A>  streams, we need to ensure that 
the new streams produced are <A 
HREF="#independence"><EM>independent</EM></A> of the 
streams available on all other processors. SPRNG produces such 
independent streams without performing any communication with other 
processors. The only SPRNG function that could involve communication 
between processors is <SAMP>make_sprng_seed</SAMP>. 
<P> 
 
 
<A NAME="macros"></A> 
<DT> <STRONG>Macro Substitution</STRONG> 
<P> <DD> A SPRNG user may need to use preprocessing directives for 
macro substitution, which C users will be familiar with. A statement 
of the form: 
<P> 
<SAMP>#define</SAMP> <VAR> macro replacement</VAR> 
<P> 
replaces the text <VAR>macro</VAR> in the user's file with 
<VAR>replacement</VAR>. For example, the SPRNG <A 
HREF="#header"><EM>header files</EM></A> define a 
macro: 
<P> 
<SAMP> #define SPRNG_DEFAULT 0</SAMP> 
<P> 
If users <A HREF="#include"><EM>include</EM></A> a 
SPRNG header file and then type the word <SAMP>SPRNG_DEFAULT</SAMP> anywhere 
in their program, then this word is replaced by <SAMP>0</SAMP> once 
the program has been preprocessed. FORTRAN users can read more about 
the preprocessing directives in the 
<A HREF="#preprocess">note</A> on this topic.  
<P> 
 
<A NAME="null"></A> 
<DT> <STRONG>NULL Pointer</STRONG> 
<P> <DD> Certain SPRNG functions return a NULL pointer in case of 
error. FORTRAN users can consider a NULL pointer as the integer constant 
<SAMP>0</SAMP>. 
<P> 
 
 
<A NAME="portability"></A> 
<DT> <STRONG>Portability</STRONG> 
<P> <DD> SPRNG is portable to a variety of serial and parallel 
platforms. Exactly the same sequence of random numbers are produced on 
all the machines. SPRNG also provides executables to check if the 
SPRNG libraries have ported correctly to the platform the user is working 
on. The section on <A HREF="install.html">installation</A> contains 
further details on these executables.  
 
<P> 
 
<A NAME="quality"></A>  
<DT> <STRONG>Quality of Parallel Random Number Streams</STRONG>  
<P>  
<DD> Parallel random number <A 
HREF="#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> must satisfy all 
the criteria for an acceptable serial random number stream. For 
example, they must be sufficiently uniform, have a large period and 
there should be no correlation between the numbers in the sequence. In 
addition, parallel streams should be uncorrelated with each other. 
<P> 
 
 
<A NAME="stream"></A>  
<DT> <STRONG>Random Number Streams</STRONG>  
<P>  
<DD> Given a random number generator and its initial <A 
HREF="#state"><EM>state</EM></A>, each call to the 
generator produces the next random number in the sequence. We refer to 
each such sequence of random numbers as a random number 
<EM>stream</EM>. 
<P> 
 
 
<A NAME="reproducibility"></A>  
<DT> <STRONG>Reproducibility</STRONG>  
<P>  
<DD> SPRNG can be used to produce a totally reproducible <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A>  of 
parallel pseudorandom numbers, independent of the number of processors 
used in the computation and of the loading produced by sharing of the 
parallel computer. Such reproducibility is important during debugging 
and also in checking codes ported to new platforms. 
<P> 
 
 
 
 
 
<A NAME="seed"></A>  
<DT> <STRONG>Seed</STRONG>  
<P>  
<DD> We use the term <EM>seed</EM> with a slightly different meaning 
than is conventionally used. This term does not refer to the starting 
<A HREF="#state"><EM>state</EM></A> of the random 
number <A HREF="#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A>. Rather, it is an encoding of the starting 
state. Distinct streams <A 
HREF="#initialize"><EM>initialized</EM></A>  with the same seed will have 
different starting states. This provides users the convenience of 
being able to use the same seed for distinct streams, and still obtaining 
different initial states.  
 
<P> 
There is a large set of possible  starting 
states for each stream. We restrict the user to  
choosing from 2<SUP>31</SUP> of those. The user can specify a particular seed 
(which is an integer) based on which SPRNG determines a particular 
starting state for the stream. Seeds that are close to each other may 
produce very different starting states. 
<P> 
It is recommended that the user use the same seed while initializing 
all the streams in one particular computational run. In order to get a 
different sequence in a different run, the user can change this common seed. 
<P> 
 
 
 
<A NAME="spawn"></A>  
<DT> <STRONG>Spawning Random Number Streams</STRONG>  
<P>  
<DD> Sometimes it is necessary to create new random number 
<A HREF="#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A>. This situation is best explained with the help of an example. 
<P> 
Consider the following Monte Carlo application in neutronics. Here 
independent neutron paths are generated based on the outcome of many 
probabilistic events. Statistics are collected along the paths and 
estimates for quantities of interest are computed. These estimates 
have a standard error that scales with the reciprocal of the square 
root of the number of "independent neutron paths". The computational 
catch is that during a flight a neutron may collide with a heavy 
nucleus thereby producing new neutrons. These new neutrons, along with 
their initial conditions, are put into a computational queue for later 
processing. An efficient parallel implementation demands that this 
queue be distributed.  In order to ensure <A 
HREF="#reproducibility"><EM>reproducibility</EM></A>, 
each neutron in the queue must also have information so that a unique 
and deterministic stream of pseudorandom numbers will be used 
regardless of which processor it eventually executes on. We also 
desire that the pseudorandom numbers streams that are allocated for 
each neutron be independent of the stream of any other 
neutron. 
<P> 
In order to satisfy the requirements of problems such as the one 
above, we provide a SPRNG function that spawns new, <A 
HREF="#independence"><EM>independent</EM></A> random number 
streams based on the information available from an existing stream. In 
the neutron collision problem above, new streams would be spawned for 
each neutron that results from the collision based on the stream of 
the original neutron that collided. SPRNG further guarantees that the 
streams produced are independent of any other stream that exists. 
<P> 
 
 
<A NAME="stderr"></A>  
<DT> <STRONG>Standard Error</STRONG>  
<P>  
<DD> SPRNG error and warning messages are sent to the standard 
error. Users should note that redirecting the standard output to a  
file does not redirect the standard error too. The following example 
demonstrates how to redirect standard error to a file 
<VAR>filename</VAR> in the Bourne and Korn shells: 
<P> 
<SAMP>a.out 2> </SAMP><VAR>filename</VAR> 
<P> 
where <SAMP>a.out</SAMP> is the user's executable. If the user wishes 
to redirect standard output and standard error to the same file, they 
can issue the following command: 
<P> 
<SAMP>a.out > </SAMP><VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP> 2>&1 </SAMP> 
<P> 
The above can be accomplished in the C shell by the following command: 
<P> 
<SAMP>a.out >& </SAMP><VAR>filename</VAR> 
<P> 
 
 
<A NAME="state"></A>  
<DT> <STRONG>State of a stream</STRONG>  
<P>  
<DD> In order to generate random numbers from a <A 
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>stream</EM></A>, SPRNG needs to 
store information about that stream in memory. This can be considered 
the <EM>state</EM> of that stream. As we progress along the random number 
sequence, this state of the stream too keeps changing.  
<P> 
In the simplest 
case, we may just need to know the previous random number generated in 
order to produce the next. In this case, the state of the stream could 
be identical to the integer version of the random number generated. In 
order to produce a double precision number, we could divide the state 
by an appropriate value to get a floating point number in the range 
[0,1). In a more complicated case, for example with the <A 
HREF="generators.html#lcg48">48 bit Linear 
Congruential Generator</A>, the state consists of the multiplier, the 
prime addend and a 48 bit integer. We return the 31 high order bits 
as the integer random number. This example was given to demonstrate 
that the state of a stream is not always identical to the integer random 
number generated. The state of the <A HREF="generators.html#lfg"> Lagged Fibonacci
Generator</A>, for instance, requires far more memory and consists of several elements of the 
sequence. 
<P> 
It should be noted that the state of the stream changes in the same 
manner, irrespective of whether the integer or 
the double precision generator was called. 
<P> 
 
 
<P> 
 
<A NAME="ID"></A>  
<DT> <STRONG>Stream ID</STRONG>  
<P>  
<DD> A single process may have several different random number <A 
HREF="#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> available. These 
different streams are distinguished by unique <EM>ID's</EM>, which are implemented as pointers 
to memory locations where <A 
HREF="#state"><EM>states</EM></A> of the 
respective streams are stored. Since standard FORTRAN 77 does not have 
a pointer 
type, we can store a pointer as an integer of the same size as a C 
pointer.  We have defined a <A 
HREF="#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> called  <A 
HREF="macros.html"><SAMP>SPRNG_POINTER</SAMP></A> in the file <A 
HREF="sprng.html#sprngf"><SAMP>sprng_f.h</SAMP></A> that 
automatically defines an integer of the correct size on  
platforms on which SPRNG is supported. A FORTRAN programmer can then 
use the type <SAMP>SPRNG_POINTER</SAMP> just as if it were a FORTRAN data 
type. However, if the flag <SAMP>-DPOINTERSIZE</SAMP> was used in 
<A HREF="makefile.html">building</A> SPRNG FORTRAN executables, then this flag should also be used 
in compiling the user's program for this feature to work correctly.  
<P>
