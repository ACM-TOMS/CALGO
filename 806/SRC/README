                         SPRNG Libraries
                         ---------------
        (http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Apps/CMP/RNG/www/install.html)
        (http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Apps/CMP/RNG/www/makefile.html)

This directory contains the source code for the SPRNG libraries, and
certain other test executables. 

Select the platform and installation directory, as explained in
../make.CHOICES. Please read ../README too.

Next, typing the command below   => results in the following being created:
      make              => Fortran and C libraries for all the generators,
                             Timing executables, test executables
      make lfg		=> Modified Additive Lagged Fibonacci Generator
      make mlfg		=> Multiplicative Lagged Fibonacci Generator
      make lcg		=> 48 bit Linear Congruential Generator
      make lcg64	=> 64 bit Linear Congruential Generator
      make pmlcg	=> Prime Modulus Linear Congruential Generator
                             (Requires GMP library)
      make cmrg		=> Combined Multiple Recursive Generator

Object files created during the compilation process can be deleted finally
by typing
       make clean
