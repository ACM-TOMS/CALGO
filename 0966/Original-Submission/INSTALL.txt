How to install

    First of all, it is very important to notice that this software was
designed to be executed in a GNU/Linux system. Attempts to install and run it
on a different platform may require a higher level of proficiency on the part
of the user.

    In order to install it correctly, it is necessary to have an installed
version of CGAL in your machine, preferably the same used in our experiments
(version 3.9). This CGAL version can be downloaded with the following link:
    - CGAL version 3.9: http://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/29125/CGAL-3.9.tar.gz

    In addition, you will also need to have at least one ILP solver
installed in your machine. This solver can be:
    - GLPK version 4.52: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/glpk-4.52.1.tar.gz
    - XPRESS version 7.0

    It does not mean that employing a different version of these libraries will
cause the program to fail. However, it is safer to use the mentioned versions,
since all experiments were done using them.

    Below you find a list of other software solutions known to be necessary in
order to correctly install AGSol:
    - cmake (2.8.7)
    - libgmp (libgmp.so.10.2)
    - libmpfr (libmpfr.4.1.0)
    - g++ (4.6.3)
    - libboost (including libboost-thread) (libboost 1.46.1)

    It is important to notice that these auxiliary libraries must be installed
before CGAL installation.

    Finally, to install the AGP Solver, you must run the command below in the
root directory of the package:

    ?> ./build-all.sh -DGLPK_PATH=<path in the system> -DXPRESS_PATH=<path in
     the system>

    Where the <path in the system> expression means that the solver's library
is located in '<path in the system>/lib' and that the header folder of the
solver can be found in '<path in the system>/include'.

    If you have only installed GLPK, type:

    ?> ./build-all.sh -DGLPK_PATH=<path in the system>

    Similarly, if you only want to use XPRESS, you don't need to put
information about GLPK.

    If you want to clean all folders, just run the shell script called
'clean-all.sh'.


=== AGSol installation on Ubuntu 14.04 ====
    
    As an example of how to install the AGSol solution in your machine, we
present the installation procedure in a clean Ubuntu 14.04.

(1) Install all the auxiliary dependencies, using the following command 
line:
?> sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libboost-dev libboost-thread-dev

(2) Download the CGAL package using the following link:
http://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/29125/CGAL-3.9.tar.gz.

(3) Enter in 'CGAL-3.9' folder and use the following commands:
?> cmake CMakeLists.txt
?> make
?> sudo make install

(4) Download the GLPK package from the link presented below:
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/glpk-4.52.1.tar.gz

(5) Install the AGSol package using the following commands:
?> ./configure
?> make
?> sudo make install

(6) Run the following command to configure the dynamic linker run-time 
bindings:
?> sudo ldconfig 

(7) Enter the agsol folder and compile AGSol running the command below: 
?> ./build-all.sh -DGLPK_PATH=/usr/local

The final binary will be placed in "agsol/art-gallery-pg" and is called 
'artGallerySolver'.
