{\bf Abstract.} \vspace{0.1cm} \\


This paper is based on a recent work by Kojima which extended 
sums of squares relaxations of polynomial optimization problems
 to polynomial semidefinite programs. 
Let ${\cal E}$ and ${\cal E}_+$ be a finite dimensional real vector space 
and a symmetric cone embedded in ${\cal E}$;
examples of $\calE$ and $\calE_+$ include
a pair of the $N$-dimensional Euclidean space and its 
nonnegative orthant, 
a pair of the $N$-dimensional 
Euclidean space and $N$-dimensional second order cones, and a pair of 
the space of $m \times m$ real symmetric (or complex Hermitian) matrices  
and the cone of their positive semidefinite matrices.  
Sums of squares relaxations
%, which are originated from pioneering works by 
% Lasserre and Parrilo,  
are further extended to 
a polynomial optimization problem over  ${\cal E}_+$, 
{\it i.e.}, a minimization of a  
real valued polynomial $a(\bx)$  in the $n$-dimensional real 
variable vector $\bx$ % $ = (x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$
over a compact feasible region 
$\{ \bx : b(\bx) \in {\cal E}_+\}$,  
where $b(\bx)$ denotes an $\cal E$-valued polynomial in $\bx$.  
It is shown under a certain moderate assumption on the $\cal E$-valued polynomial $b(\bx)$ 
that optimal values of a sequence of sums of squares relaxations of the 
problem, which are converted into a sequence of semidefinite programs when they are 
numerically solved, converge to the optimal value of the problem.
