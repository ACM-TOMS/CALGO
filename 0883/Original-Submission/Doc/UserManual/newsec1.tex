\section{Introduction}


SparsePOP is a matlab package for finding global optimal solutions of polynomial
optimization problems (POPs). 
The package is an implementation
of a sparse semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation method for POPs  in  \cite{WAKI04}, proposed
to improve
the efficiency of  Lasserre's hierarchy of LMI relaxations of increasing dimensions 
\cite{LAS01}.  SparsePOP
exploits the sparsity of POPs in a way that it can handle  POPs of larger dimensions.
See also \cite{KIM03,KOJ03a}. 


A general POP is described as follows: 
Let $\Real^n$ and $\Integer^n_+$  denote the $n$-dimensional
Euclidean space and the set of nonnegative integer vectors in $\Real^n$, respectively. 
A real-valued polynomial $f_k(\x)$ 
in $\x =(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) \in \Real^n$ is expressed as
\[
	\begin{array}{lllll}
     f_k(\x) & = \displaystyle \sum_{\balpha \in \FC_k} c_k(\balpha) \x^{\salpha},\ \x \in \Real^n,   \
	 c_k(\balpha)  & \in \Real, \ 
	\FC_k  \subset \Integer_+^n
	\end{array}
\]
$(k=0,1,2,\ldots,m)$, where      
$\displaystyle \x^{\salpha} = x_1^{\alpha_1}x_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots
x_n^{\alpha_n}$ for every $\x =(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) \in \Real^n$ and 
every $\balpha \in \Integer^n_+$.

We consider a POP in the following form: 
\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{array}{llll}
\mbox{minimize } & f_0(\x) \\
\mbox{subject to } & f_k (\x) \geq 0 & (k=1,2,\ldots,\ell), \\
                                 & f_k(\x) = 0 & (k=\ell+1,\ldots,m), \\
                                 & \mbox{lbd}_i \leq x_i \leq \mbox{ubd}_i & (i=1,2,\ldots,n), 
\end{array}
\right\} \label{POP0}
\end{equation}
where $-\infty \leq  \mbox{lbd}_i < \infty$ and $-\infty <  \mbox{ubd}_i \leq \infty$ $(i=1,2,\ldots,n)$. 
Let $\zeta^*$ denote the optimal value of the POP (\ref{POP0}). 

The package accepts a POP as input, and outputs 
solution information and statistics. The main part 
constructs a sparse SDP relaxation  of  the POP  and uses
SeDuMi \cite{STRUM99} to obtain an approximate global optimal solution.
The structure of the software package SparsePOP is shown in Figure \ref{structure}.

The function sparsePOP.m is the main function of SparsePOP. 
Note the difference in the names of the function sparsePOP.m and 
%while the package name is the SparsePOP.
the package SparsePOP.
As %will be seen
will be shown in Section~\ref{Representation},
sparsePOP.m accepts two different formats of a POP:
the \GMS format \cite{GAMS} that is more readable,
and  the SparsePOP format, a set of 
MATLAB data types designed exclusively for SparsePOP. If a POP is read in the \GMS format, 
then a subfunction readGMS.m %of the sparsePOP.m
 converts a \GMS format of the POP 
to a sparsePOP format of the POP.  It is followed by checking the validity  of 
the SparsePOP format of the POP and the parameters optionally 
provided by the user or given by default.  Then, either SDPrelaxation.m or SDPrelaxationMex.m 
transforms the POP into an SDP relaxation problem, and solves it with a MATLAB SDP solver 
SeDuMi. Once the POP (\ref{POP0}) is solved, 
the solution information is written using the MATLAB function printSolution.m. We refer to the paper 
\cite{WAKI04} for numerical results from SparsePOP. 

The conversion from a POP to an SDP relaxation problem can be time-consuming if implemented
with MATLAB. The subfunction SDPrelaxationMex.m is developed in C++ to speed up this process.
SparsePOP provides an option for choosing SDPrelaxation.m or SDPrelaxationMex.m.
If   the C++ source programs can be compiled and linked
into mex files,  the SDPrelaxationMex.m is recommended.  Otherwise,
the value of the parameter {\sf param.mex} should be changed
from {\sf param.mex = 1} to {\sf param.mex = 0} in the defaultParameter.m to choose the 
SDPrelaxation.m.
