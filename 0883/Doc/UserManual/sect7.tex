\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{remarks}

We have described the structure and usage of the software package SparsePOP.
Solving POPs has been known  difficult mainly because the size of SDP relaxation
of POPs becomes increasingly large as the degree and the number of variables
of POPs grow. In addition, numerical difficulties occur for various reasons.
SparsePOP is, by far, one of the most successful software packages to address
these issues among currently available softwares. 
Main advantage comes from constructing SDP relaxations of reduced size
by utilizing the sparsity of POPs. 
In particular, unconstrained problems with 1000 variables has been solved using
the  sparsity. For sparse constrained problems, the number of variables of solvable problems by SparsePOP is 10-30. 
See the paper \cite{WAKI04} for extensive numerical results.
