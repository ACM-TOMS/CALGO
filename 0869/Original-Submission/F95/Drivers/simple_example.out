 *** Initial summary for fit by method of ODR ***

 --- Problem Size:
            N =     4          (number with nonzero weight =     4)
           NQ =     1
            M =     1
           NP =     2          (number unfixed =     2)

 --- Control Values:
          JOB = 00000
              = ABCDE, where
                       A=0 ==> fit is not a restart.
                       B=0 ==> deltas are initialized to zero.
                       C=0 ==> covariance matrix will be computed using
                               derivatives re-evaluated at the solution.
                       D=0 ==> derivatives are estimated by forward differences.
                       E=0 ==> method is explicit ODR.
       NDIGIT =    16          (estimated by ODRPACK95)

 --- Stopping Criteria:
        SSTOL =     1.49E-08   (sum of squares stopping tolerance)
