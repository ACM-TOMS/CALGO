 *** Initial summary for fit by method of ODR ***

 --- Problem Size:
            N =    12          (number with nonzero weight =    12)
           NQ =     1
            M =     1
           NP =     3          (number unfixed =     3)

 --- Control Values:
          JOB = 00020
              = ABCDE, where
                       A=0 ==> fit is not a restart.
                       B=0 ==> deltas are initialized to zero.
                       C=0 ==> covariance matrix will be computed using
                               derivatives re-evaluated at the solution.
                       D=2 ==> derivatives are supplied by user.
                               derivatives were checked.
                               results appear correct.
                       E=0 ==> method is explicit ODR.
       NDIGIT =    16          (estimated by ODRPACK95)

       PARTOL =     3.67E-11   (parameter stopping tolerance)
        MAXIT =    50          (maximum number of iterations)

 --- Initial Weighted Sum of Squares        =                    6.63720354E+05
