   DELAUNAYSPARSE: Interpolation via the Delaunay Triangulation.

The package DELAUNAYSPARSE contains serial and parallel codes, written
in FORTRAN 2003 with OpenMP, for performing interpolation in medium to
high dimensions via a sparse subset of the Delaunay triangulation. The
serial driver subroutine is DELAUNAYSPARSES and the parallel driver is
DELAUNAYSPARSEP. Both subroutines use the REAL_PRECISION module from
HOMPACK90 (ACM TOMS Algorithm 777) for approximately 64-bit precision
on all known machines, and the SLATEC subroutine DWNNLS (ACM TOMS
Algorithm 587) for solving an inequality constrained least squares
problem. Additionally, DELAUNAYSPARSE depends on several BLAS and LAPACK
subroutines. The module DELSPARSE_MOD contains the REAL_PRECISION (R8)
data type, and interface blocks for DELAUNAYSPARSES, DELAUNAYSPARSEP,
and DWNNLS. Comments at the top of each subroutine document their
usage, and examples demonstrating their usage are provided in the
sample programs samples.f90 and samplep.f90.

The physical organization is as follows:

 * The file deslparse.f90 contains the module REAL_PRECISION,
   DELSPARSE_MOD, and the driver subroutines DELAUNAYSPARSES, and
   DELAUNAYSPARSEP.
 * The file slatec.f contains the subroutine DWNNLS and its dependencies
   from the SLATEC library. This library has been slightly modified to
   comply with the modern Fortran standards. Additionally, legacy
   implementations of the BLAS subroutines DROTM and DTROMG have been
   included under different names to avoid dependency issues.
 * The file samples.f90 contains a sample main program demonstrating the
   usage of DELAUNAYSPARSES, with optional arguments.
 * The file samplep.f90 contains a sample main program demonstrating the
   usage of DELAUNAYSPARSEP, with optional arguments.
 * The file test_install.f90 contains a simple test program that checks
   whether the installation of DELAUNAYSPARSE appears correct, based
   on the output to a small interpolation/extrapolation problem.
 * The file sample_input2d.dat contains a sample 2-dimensional input
   data set for samples.f90 and samplep.f90.
 * The file sample_input4d.dat contains a sample 4-dimensional input
   data set for samples.f90 and samplep.f90.
 * The files lapack.f and blas.f contain all LAPACK and BLAS
   subroutines that are referenced (both directly and indirectly) in
   DELAUNAYSPARSE.

From here on, the files samples.f90 and samplep.f90 will be referred
to collectively as sample{s|p}.f90 and the files sample_input2d.dat
and sample_input4d.dat will be referred to collectively as
sample_input{2|4}d.dat.

To check that the installation of DELAUNAYSPARSES and DELAUNAYSPARSEP is
correct, assuming that your Fortran compiler allows mixing fixed format
.f and free format .f90 files in the same compile command, use the command

$FORT $OPTS delsparse.f90 slatec.f lapack.f blas.f test_install.f90 \
  -o test_install $LIBS

where '$FORT' is a Fortran 2003 compliant compiler supporting OpenMP
4.5, '$OPTS' is a list of compiler options, and '$LIBS' is a list of
flags to link the BLAS and LAPACK libraries, if those exist on your
system (in which case the files blas.f and lapack.f can be omitted
from the compile command). To run the parallel code, $OPTS must
include the compiler option for OpenMP.

Then run the tests using

./test_install

To compile and link the sample main programs sample{s|p}.f90, use

$FORT $OPTS delsparse.f90 slatec.f lapack.f blas.f sample{s|p}.f90 \
  -o sample{s|p} $LIBS

similar to above.  To run a sample main program, use

./sample{s|p} sample_input{2|4}d.dat

where 'sample_input{2|4}d.dat' could be replaced by any other similarly
formatted data file.
