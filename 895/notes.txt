CFSF : a continued fractions package for special functions
==========================================================

This bundle contains all files belonging to CFSF,
a continued fractions package for special functions,
written in Maple.

Notes about the current release:

- Instead of showing the whole output of a formula that does not
  have a label, formula only shows the type of the formula, followed
  by three dots.  To display the complete formula object, use eval.
