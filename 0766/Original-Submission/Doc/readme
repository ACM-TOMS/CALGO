This directory contains FORTRAN 90 code for computing Pade'-Hermite and 
simultaneous Pade' approximants, plus two driver programs. To obtain a run,
first compile the code in the files 
            driver1.f, vector_pade.f and linpack.f
or, in the files 
            driver2.f, vector_pade.f and linpack.f.

driver1.f:      
First driver program for vector_pade.f. It also gives code for computing 
the inverse of a Striped Sylvester matrix using the formula derived in 
sylvester_inverses.ps.Z. No input data is required by this driver.
Contains the programs:
        main
        invert_sylv
        solve_sylv
        divide_series:

driver2.f:      
Second driver program for vector_pade.f. It also gives code for computing 
the errors in the order conditions for the Pade'-Hermite and
simultaneous Pade' systems computed by VECTOR_PADE. This driver does require
input data, a sample of which is given in the file data_for_driver2.
Contains the programs:
        main
        build_delta_t
        build_delta_t_star

vector_pade.f: 
Based on the algorithm given in stable_pade_alg.ps.Z and used for the 
experiments described in experiments_pade_alg.ps.Z: Contains the subroutines:
        vector_pade:
        build_t:
        build_t_star:
        build_s:
        build_s_star:
        scale_s:
        scale_s_star:
        mult_s
        mult_s_star
        norm:
        gen_next_vector:

linpack.f:
Collection of LINPACK subroutines used by vector_pade.f. Contains the 
subroutines:
        sgefa:
        sgesl:
        saxpy:
        isamax:
        sscal:
        sswap:
        sdot:
