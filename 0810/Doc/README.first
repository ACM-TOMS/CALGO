In order to make this code compatible with the other CALGO codes
there has been a renaming of filenames. This hasn't gone through to
the documentation; the mappings are

coupdr -> driver1
drive  -> driver2
sepdr  -> driver3
sleign2.f -> src.f

data2 needs to be renamed auto.in before running driver2 in
automatic mode.
