Notes
=====
When using pzevcdriver to test large matrices (>1500), one should use
the pzlatrs routine provided in the SRC directory.  This will control
scaling problems when pztrevc is calculating eigenvectors.  It is,
however, slow in comparison to PZTRSV which it is replacing.

Note also that pzlatrs uses pzdotu, pzdotc, and pzaxpy.  I found a bug
in each of these routines that were included in ScaLAPACK 1.0.  Thus,
up-to-date versions are included in the SRC directory.  

See the README file in the SRC directory for more information.
