Notes
=====
The routine ZLAHQR included in this distribution is not the same as found 
in LAPACK 1.0.  This routine uses a multiple double-shift strategy as is 
found in DLAHQR.  This is included for completeness, but is not needed.  It 
can be removed from the list of codes in the Makefile so that the default
LAPACK ZLAHQR is used instead.

PZLATRS is an updated version of the routine included in ScaLAPACK 1.0.
It has been updated to use scaling.  It is, however, very slow in comparision 
to PZTRSV which theoretically does the same computation.  Although slow,
it controls scaling for ill-conditioned problems.

PZLATRS calls some PBLAS and BLAS routines.  I found that some of the 
PBLAS routines (ScaLAPACK version 1.0) each have an undocumented bug in 
them.  They are
  PZAXPY  line 363    &desc_Y[LLD_] -> incy
  PZDOTU  line 472    ixcol -> iycol
  PZDOTC  line 471    ixcol -> iycol
Thus, I have included these three update level 1 PBLAS routines with this 
distribution.
