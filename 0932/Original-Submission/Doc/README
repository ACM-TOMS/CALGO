An Algorithm for Non-Matching Grid Projections Version 1 June 2012.
Authors: Martin J. Gander and Caroline Japhet

We design an algorithm with linear complexity to perform
projections between 2d and 3d non-matching grids. This algorithm is
based on an advancing front technique and neighboring
information. Its implementation is surprisingly short, and we give the
entire Matlab code. For computing the intersections, we use a direct and
numerically robust approach. 

To perform an simple example, in 2d or 3d respectively, first go in directory test/
then add path

addpath ../source/2d:../source/3d

Then run:

example2d.m
example3d.m

Or to illustrate the optimal complexity and negligible overhead of the algorithm, run:

complexity2d.m
complexity3d.m
