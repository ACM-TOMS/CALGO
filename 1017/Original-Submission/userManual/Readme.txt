The Latex source files for the user manual use the R facility to include R source code and the graphical results of executing this code into the document. This uses Sweave.

The bottom line is that you need to use something like RStudio to generate the pdf file provided here. It would be possible to separately generate the figures and substitute these into the document (along with directives to generate source listings); but the main body of the text of the user manual is available in the .tex file.
