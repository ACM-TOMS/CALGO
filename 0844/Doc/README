This directory contains Matlab programs to compute SPQR (Sparse
Pivoted QR) decompositions and SCRA (Sparse Column Row) reduced-rank
approximations.  In addition to functions spqr.m and scra.m, the
directory contains the following files.

testspqr.m     A script that runs spqr on parameter controlled test
               cases.

driver_spqr.m  A driver for testspqr.m.

res_driver     The output from driver.

testscra.m     A script that runs scra on parameter controlled test
               cases.

timescra.m     A script that gives comparative timings of scra and
               the Matlab sparse SVD routine svds.

spqr.ps        A preprint of a TOMS paper describing the decompositions and
               their implementations.
