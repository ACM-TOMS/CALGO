This folder gathers various small to medium experiments done with pySDC. They are for example grouped by application (e.g. ``Boris``) or by problem type (e.g. ``ODEs``).
Also, the ``deprecated`` folder lists a few old applications which have not been ported to the current version of `pySDC`.
Experiments which become more complex or which eventually evolve into a publication of any form should go to the ``projects`` folder and should receive proper documentation and description.
The playground codes are supposed to be cleaned up, but there is no detailed documentation available.
