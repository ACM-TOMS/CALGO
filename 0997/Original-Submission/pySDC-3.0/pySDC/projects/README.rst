In the ``projects`` folder we gather focussed experiments with pySDC which go beyond simple toy problems or feature tests.
In particular, projects are structured and documented codes which form the basis for publications or presentations.
All projects are expected to contain a README file describing the intention and content of the work.
Parts of the Python scripts are supported by tests and checked for PEP8 conformity.
