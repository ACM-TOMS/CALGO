PARyOpt (pronounced **pur-yopt**, with a hard *y*) is a modular asynchronous Bayesian optimization package that enables
remote function evaluation.

It is written to solve optimization problems where the cost function is very expensive to evaluate
(on the order of hours), and where cost functions must be evaluated on remote machines (HPC clusters).
