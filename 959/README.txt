This Algorithm code requires the following software packages:

1. NTL: A Library for doing Number Theory 
   Available from: http://www.shoup.net/ntl/ (Last Checked: 8 July 2015)

2. Only required for improved efficiency -- the algorithm
   code should build with only 1. above

   The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
   Available from: https://gmplib.org/ (Last Checked: 8 July 2015)

The SupportPackages directory contains:

   NTL -- version 9.2.0
   GMP -- version 6.0.0

and the algorithm software has been compiled and executed successfully
using these versions of the libraries. The compiler used was

g++ (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4
