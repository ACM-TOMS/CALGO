Mixed-volume computation and polyhedral continuation by dynamic lifting.

The aim of dynamic lifting is to control the heights of the lifting
values, to obtain a stable evaluation of the polyhedral homotopy.

When all supports are equal, then the mixed volume is reduced to an
ordinary volume, which is computed by a regular triangulation.
