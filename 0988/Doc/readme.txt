AMGKQ: [RES, ERR, NSUB, FL] = amgkq(F, A, B, C, EAER, MAXNSUB, NGK, TTYPE, SFLAG, CFLAG, VERB, P1, P2, ...)

DESCRIPTION: Adaptive, multidimensional Gauss-Kronrod quadrature for simultaneous integrands.
Computes the integral of F(X) from A to B in ND dimensions.  Improper integrals with infinite
limits A or B are supported.  Limits A and B do not have to be ordered low to high. Complex
line (contour) integrals require ND = 1 and finite limits A and B.  Multiple simultaneous
integrands are supported, e.g. F(X) = [F1(X); F2(X); ...].  The number of dimensions ND and
the number of integrands NF are not limited. 

INPUT: (F, A, B) are required; (C, EAER, MAXNSUB, NGK, TTYPE, SFLAG, CFLAG, VERB, P1, P2, ...) are optional.
Pass an empty matrix [] to select the default value of an optional input argument.
F = integrand F(X) to be described later
[A, B] = limits of integration as column vectors with ND rows
C = matrix of size [ND, NC] giving breakpoint (boundary) locations, default to (A + B)/2
EAER = requested error with one or two elements, e.g. EAER = EA or EAER = [EA, ER]
  EA = requested absolute error >= 0, default to sqrt(eps) < 1.5e-08
  ER = requested relative error >= 0, default to 0, TOL = max(EA, ER*ABSRES0)
MAXNSUB = maximum number of subregions to evaluate, default to ND*1e2, required > NC*2^ND - NC + 1
NGK = order of Gauss-Kronrod quadrature rules, default to 7, required > 1
TTYPE = trigonometric (1) or rational (2) transformation type, e.g. TTYPE = TBTH or TTYPE = [TFIN, TINF]
  TFIN = type for finite limit transformation (both A and B), default to 1 = trigonometric
  TINF = type for infinite limit transformation (either or both A and B), default to 1 = trigonometric
  TBTH = type for both finite and infinite limit transformations
SFLAG = boolean flag for subregion culling, e.g. SFLAG = SBTH or SFLAG = [SUB1, SUB2]
  SUB1 = 0 disables culling of subregions meeting convergence criterion, default to 1
  SUB2 = 0 disables culling of subregions surpassing width criterion, default to 1
  SBTH = 0 disables all culling of subregions
CFLAG = boolean flag for reordering C, CFLAG = 0 disables reordering, default to 1
VERB = integer verbosity level from -2 to 2, default to 0
     = -2 turns off termination, culling, and tolerance warnings
     = -1 turns off termination warnings
     = 0 leaves warnings on with no iteration output
     = 1 turns on some iteration output
     = 2 turns on more iteration output
[P1, P2, ...] = additional parameters passed to F when given as a string

QUADRATURE RULES: For order NGK in {7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30}, values tabulated to 1e-25 are loaded
which get rounded to double precision ~ 2e-16.  For other orders, a double precision routine is
called with round-off error ~ 2e-16.  The Gauss and Kronrod orders are NG = NGK and NK = 2*NGK+1.

INTEGRAND: F can be given as an inline function, a function handle, or a string for a function name.
When given as a string, F is converted to a function handle with additional parameters [P1, P2, ...].
F must accept a matrix X of size [ND, NX] as input and return a matrix Y of size [NF, NX] as output.
Expected calling format is Y = F(X), for example F = @(X) somefunction(X, P1, P2, ...).

OUTPUT: [RES, ERR, NSUB, FL] have the following descriptions.
RES = column vector of results with NF rows 
ERR = column vector of estimated errors with NF rows 
NSUB = scalar integer giving number of subregions evaluated
FL = output flag in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
   = -2 means NaN encountered in integrand
   = -1 means Inf encountered in integrand
   = 0 means maximum number of subregions evaluated
   = 1 means all subregions meet convergence criterion
   = 2 means estimated errors meet convergence criterion
