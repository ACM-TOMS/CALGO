  RealPaver release 0.4
  Solving Nonlinear Constraints by Interval Computations


OVERVIEW

  RealPaver is a modeling language for solving mixed-integer nonlinear
  constraint systems.

  Given a system of nonlinear constraints over the real numbers, it
  computes a paving of the solution set. A paving is a union of Cartesian
  product of interval domains (boxes) enclosing the solution set.

  The solving engine of RealPaver implements a branch-and-prune algorithm
  that alternates reduction steps of variable domains by means of
  constraint consistency techniques and bisection steps.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

  The compilation of RealPaver requires a recent ANSI C compiler,
  e.g., gcc 2.95.2, and GNU make. To date, RealPaver is known to
  compile on ix86 computers under Linux, Sun Sparc computers under
  Solaris 2.5 and SGI computers under IRIX 6.5.
