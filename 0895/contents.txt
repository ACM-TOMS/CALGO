CFSF : a continued fractions package for special functions
==========================================================

This bundle contains all files belonging to CFSF,
a continued fractions package for special functions,
written in Maple.

Directory structure:

- CFSF/functions:

  This directory contains all formula definitions that are
  initially known to the CFSF package.  It has subdirectories
  per chapter and function.

- CFSF/library:

  In this directory resides the implementation of the CFSF
  package.  It includes a Makefile for creating the library.

- CFSF/tests:

  This directory contains a sample Maple worksheet to demonstrate
  the use of the package.  It can be used to check the output
  according to the article that was submitted to ACM Toms.

System requirements:

- You will need at least Maple version 9.

Creating the library:

- To create the library, go to the CFSF/library directory,
  and issue the make command.  The location of the maple
  library should be passed to the MAPLE variable.

  $ cd CFSF/library
  $ make MAPLE=/location/of/maple

Using the library:

- To make the library available, add it to the libname variable of
  Maple.  Then load the library using the with command.

  $ maple
  > libname := libname, "/location/of/CFSF/library":
  > with(CFSF):

- By adding the libname statement to the personal Maple initialization
  file (e.g. ~/.mapleinit under Unix/Linux), you can make the library
  available at all times.  For more information, see ?mapleinit in
  Maple.
