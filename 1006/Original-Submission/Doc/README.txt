The INSTALL file has been replaced by a Makefile in the C directory. It is better to use this than the INSTALL script supplied with the package.

The source code has been split between two directories C/Src and C/Drivers. C/Src contains the library software, C/Drivers contains the driver/testing files. 

To use INSTALL requires that all the sources files are in a single directory along with the INSTALL script.
