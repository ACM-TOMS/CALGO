function newzero=nth_zero(zero2,a,b,rho,tau,type,h1_or_h2)
% Find the n-th zeros of h_1 or h_2 to define the subintervals to be
% used subsequently as endpoints of the integrals used in acceleration 
% algorithms. We use this approximation as a more precise zero-finding
% algorithm has insignificant impact in the overall efficiency of the
% toolbox.

% S. K. 2013. Algorithm XXX: IIPBF, a MATLAB toolbox for infinite integral 
% of products of two Bessel functions. To appear in ACM Transactions on 
% Mathematical Software.

% Input:
% zero2 = second zero derived from first_2_zeros.m
% func = function handle
% a,b = a,b from IIPBF.m
% rho,tau = rho,tau from IIPBF.m
% type = 'JJ', 'JY' or 'YY'
% h1_or_h2 = 1 if the zero derived is for integrating h_1, 2 for ï¿½
% integrating h_2.
% 
% Output:
% newzero = the next zero as approximated, assuming the functions behave
% like the sin function.
% 
% NOTE: Prior versions was some variation of Newton's method, which
% involved approximating derivatives and consequently required additional
% function evaluations (which is our yardstick for measuring algorithm
% efficiency). Empirical tests show there is no significant differences in
% accuracy of the quadratures if a more accurate zero is chosen.
