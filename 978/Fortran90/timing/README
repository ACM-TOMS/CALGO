This directory contains timing code used to compare the performance
of selected Level 1 BLAS routines and LAPACK auxiliary routines as
described in "Safe Scaling in the Level 1 BLAS", submitted to ACM TOMS.

Two additional BLAS/LAPACK subroutines are included in this directory:
xLAPY2:  computes sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
xLARGV:  vector version of xLARTG

As in the other parts of this package, the Makefile requires you to
set an environment variable ARCH to the name of your architecture
and to create an include file
   ../etc/Makeinclude.<arch>
with the compiler names and flags to be used.  For example,
   setenv ARCH intel
includes the settings from Makeinclude.intel.  Object files, module
files, library files, and output files are all created in subdirectories
called <arch> so that you can test multiple configurations without
overwriting previous tests.  Sample include files are provided for the
Gnu compiler (Makeinclude.gnu), the Intel compiler (Makeinclude.intel),
and the PGI compiler (Makeinclude.pgi).

The input files xbtime.in contain two sets of problem sizes, one for
comparing results using the same vectors repeatedly for an in-cache
timing, and one for comparing results using different vectors for an
out-of-cache timing.

If ARCH has already been set, timing results can be generated by
   make
   make check
or the timing programs can be run manually, for example,
   intel/sbtime < sbtime.in
