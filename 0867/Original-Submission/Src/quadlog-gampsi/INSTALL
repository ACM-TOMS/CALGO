In order to make the "make check" output more readable, it is
important to have a diff implementation that can ignore small
differences in numerical values.

The recommanded program for this purpose is ndiff, which may be
distributed as part of this system, and otherwise, is freely available
at

	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/misc/ndiff-x.yy.tar.gz
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/misc/ndiff-x.yy.tar.gz

where x.yy is a version number (2.00 the time of writing).

The "make check" step in the Makefile will dynamically search for an
installed ndiff in the PATH, and use it, if it can be found.
Otherwise, diff will be used.

Hewlett-Packard HP-UX systems have a make implementation that
intreprets # characters inside strings as comment starters.  This
breaks the ndiff Makefile, which has

SEDCMD		= $(SED) -e 's%AWK=.*$$%AWK=$(AWK)%' \
			-e 's%LIBDIR=/.*$$%LIBDIR=$(shrlibdir)%' \
			-e 's%@LIBDIR@%$(shrlibdir)%g' \
			-e 's%@BINDIR@%$(bindir)%g' \
			-e 's%@VERSIONREGEXP@%$(VERSION)%g' \
			-e 's%@DATE@%$(DATE)%g' \
			-e 's%^\#! /bin/sh%\#! $(SHELL)%'

Changing the two # instances on the last line to their octal escapes,
\043, fixed the problem on HP-UX.  If this change can be shown to
work on all platforms, it will be incorporated in the next release
of ndiff (which is otherwise stable, reliable, and builds everywhere).
