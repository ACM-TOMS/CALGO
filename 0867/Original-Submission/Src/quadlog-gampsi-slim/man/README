%% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>

All of the *.man files are produced automatically from the ../*/*.f
files, using ../fortran-to-man-page.sh, with these exceptions:

original hand written:
	gjqf.man
	gjqfd.man
	glqf.man
	glqfd.man

produced by ../fortran-to-man-page.sh, then make this substitution:

	(query-replace "\\fBpsi\\fP\\&" "psi" nil nil nil)

This change is needed because psi() is both a mathematical function
name (what is intended in the documentation), and a routine name
(which got set in bold by ../fortran-to-man-page.sh, but should not
have been).

	psi.man
