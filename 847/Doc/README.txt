INSTALLATION
------------
1) You should have obtained this software as a .zip file. Please uncompress 
the archive to a directory of your choice.

2) From Matlab, please execute the m-file "init" to add the sparse grid 
subroutines to the Matlab path. 

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Please use the Matlab HELP command to obtain information on the syntax of 
each function (i.e. "help spinterp"). Some demos have been included in the
subdirectory "examples". A printed documentation and a document providing 
reference results of the demos can be found in the subdirectory "doc".

For a detailed explanation of the underlying algorithms and the theory, 
please refer to "Algorithm 847: spinterp: Piecewise multilinear hierarchical 
sparse grid interpolation in Matlab" (2005, ACM Transactions on Mathematical 
Software 31:4).
