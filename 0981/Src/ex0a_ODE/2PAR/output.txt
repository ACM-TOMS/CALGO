         Application of Talbot's method to solve the ODE equation

			f'''' + 18*f'' + 81*f = 0,         t>0

	with conditions:

			f(0) = f'(0) = f'''(0) = 0
			f''(0) = 1

	The analytical solution is

		f(t) = t*sin(3*t)/6

	and its Laplace Transform is

		            s
		F(s) = -----------
		       (s^2 + 9)^2

	with double poles at +/-3i

	     and abscissa of convergence: sigma0 = 0
