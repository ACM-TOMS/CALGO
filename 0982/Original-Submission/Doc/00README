To build the demonstration program Decay, adjust the FC (Fortran compiler)
and FOPTS (Fortran compiler command-line options) variables in the
Makefile, and "make Decay".

The Decay program reads an input file from standard input.

Command line options control what solutions are computed, and what
is printed:

Usage: ./Decay [options] [input [output]]
 Options:
  -l     => Time step and Final time (-s and -t) are log10 of time.
            If time step is not an integer, you might wish to
            select a slightly larger final time, to compute the
            desired number of steps.
  -m     => Print moles instead of grams
  -s[ ]# => Time step
  -t[ ]# => Final time; always starts at zero
  -u[ ]X => Time scale, X = s m h d y
  -v[ ]# => Be verbose at level #
  -w[ ]# => Display # columns, default 6
  -z     => Print columns having zero radiotoxicity
  anything else => this output
Option letters are not case sensitive.
If input is not specified, input is from stdin
If output is not specified, output is from stdout

To run the demonstration problems, we recommend

./Decay -s 100 -t 1000 -u y < Sr-Cs-solution-10.txt
./Decay -s 1 -t 20 -u d < Eu-152.txt

The second problem is included in the first one, but Eu-152 decays
so quickly that it is printed as zero starting on the second line of
output from the first problem.
