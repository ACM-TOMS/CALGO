/**
 A mega iteration of an algorithm:
 *  - generates a lot of points over multiple strategies (ex., Poll and Search for Mads).
 *  - evaluates points
 *  - performs post-processing

 The run and start functions of mega iteration must be implemented for each optimizer
 that has several phases of points creation that we want to combine before launching evaluations (for example, ::MadsMegaIteration, ::NMMegaIteration, ...).

  \note As an hypothesis, the time load is taken by the evaluation,
  which is parallelized over all evaluations simultaneously.
  The iteration generation, including trial points generation,
  has little time load, so they do not need to be parallelized.
  It is also preferable to keep parallelization to the only place where
  it matters the most to avoid errors. \n
  There is no parallelization at the algorithmic level.
  The algorithms are run in main thread(s) only; other threads are available for evaluations.
