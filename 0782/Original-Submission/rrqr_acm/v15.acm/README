Using the driver in this directory:
===================================

This directory contains the testing/timing drivers used to get the
timings published in technical report "Argonne Preprint ANL-MCS-P559-0196"
and submitted to ACM TOMS.

Note:
Take care with matrix dimensions.
The current code is prepared to run with up to 500x500 matrices.
If you want to run it with larger matrices, you should change 
constant NMAX in xqr.f files.
