*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ATIMIN interprets the input line for the timing routines.
*  The LOGICAL array TIMSUB returns .true. for each routine to be
*  timed and .false. for the routines which are not to be timed.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  PATH    (input) CHARACTER*(*)
*          The LAPACK path name of the calling routine.  The path name
*          may be at most 6 characters long.  If LINE(1:LEN(PATH)) is
*          the same as PATH, then the input line is searched for NSUBS
*          non-blank characters, otherwise, the input line is assumed to
*          specify a single subroutine name.
*
*  LINE    (input) CHARACTER*80
*          The input line to be evaluated.  The path or subroutine name
*          must begin in column 1 and the part of the line after the
*          name is used to indicate the routines to be timed.
*          See below for further details.
*
*  NSUBS   (input) INTEGER
*          The number of subroutines in the LAPACK path name of the
*          calling routine.
*
*  NAMES   (input) CHARACTER*(*) array, dimension (NSUBS)
*          The names of the subroutines in the LAPACK path name of the
*          calling routine.
*
*  TIMSUB  (output) LOGICAL array, dimension (NSUBS)
*          For each I from 1 to NSUBS, TIMSUB( I ) is set to .true. if
*          the subroutine NAMES( I ) is to be timed; otherwise,
*          TIMSUB( I ) is set to .false.
*
*  NOUT    (input) INTEGER
*          The unit number on which error messages will be printed.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          The return status of this routine.
*          = -1:  Unrecognized path or subroutine name
*          =  0:  Normal return
*          =  1:  Name was recognized, but no timing requested
*
*  Further Details
*  ======= =======
*
*  An input line begins with a subroutine or path name, optionally
*  followed by one or more non-blank characters indicating the specific
*  routines to be timed.
*
*  If the character string in PATH appears at the beginning of LINE,
*  up to NSUBS routines may be timed.  If LINE is blank after the path
*  name, all the routines in the path will be timed.  If LINE is not
*  blank after the path name, the rest of the line is searched
*  for NSUBS nonblank characters, and if the i-th such character is
*  't' or 'T', then the i-th subroutine in this path will be timed.
*  For example, the input line
*     SGE    T T T T
*  requests timing of the first 4 subroutines in the SGE path.
*
*  If the character string in PATH does not appear at the beginning of
*  LINE, then LINE is assumed to begin with a subroutine name.  The name
*  is assumed to end in column 6 or in column i if column i+1 is blank
*  and i+1 <= 6.  If LINE is completely blank after the subroutine name,
*  the routine will be timed.  If LINE is not blank after the subroutine
*  name, then the subroutine will be timed if the first non-blank after
*  the name is 't' or 'T'.
