 This is Sou-Cheng Choi's bibliograhy database and is built from the following steps:
 (1), refs.bib from Michael Saunders, relabeled to refs3.bib
 (2), setting up compilation environment (MikTex and WinEdt, latest versions) with Lek-Heng Lim's help
 (3), include the following two lines from main file

    \bibliographystyle{plain}
    \bibliography{refs3} % database refs3.bib in the same directory as this file, no .bib typed in {}.
 (4) in WinEdt,
     ->  "bibtex" button
     -> "PDF Texify" button
 (5) For published mathematical articles/books:
    (i) add bibliography items using MathSciNet's bibtex
    (i) customize contents or formats of items in (i):
        - replace " (electronic)" with empty string
        - find spelling of first names using MathSciNet or internet or Science Citation Index (SCI)
        - remove some fields like NOTE if necessary
 (6) For unpublished mathematical articles/books, use internet search engine
 (7) For Thesis, use Stanford Library to build bibtex items
 (8) For Computer Science articles/books, use internet search engine or CiteSeer
 (9) For articles from other fields, use SCI or internet search engine

 Clever tricks:
================
 (1) use the following to switch the order of two papers. Eg. PS82a, PS82b
  title={\rlap{\phantom{z}}{...}};

 Questions:
  review
 (1) inproceedings
 (2) techreport
 (3) [GG06]
