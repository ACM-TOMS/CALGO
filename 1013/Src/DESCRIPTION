Description: An implementation of a continuous spectral algorithm (specsim) for simulating stationary and intrinsic vector Gaussian random fields in Euclidian spaces. The following stationary and intrinsic covariance models can be reproduced: spherical, cubic, penta, exponential, Gaussian, Askey, Wendland, Matérn, J-Bessel, Laguerre, Hypergeometric, Power, Spline, iterated exponential, Gamma, Cauchy, stable and mixed Power. The package also provides a statistical testing to check the normality of the distribution of the simulated random field or of its generalized increments, as well as a function for mapping realizations of a simulated vector random field, a function for calculating the experimental variograms of realizations constructed on a regular grid and a function for checking sufficient validity conditions for the multivariate Matérn covariance model.
