This version has been tested under
- Matlab 7.0.1.24704 (R14) Service Pack 1 for Linux,
- Matlab 6.5.0.180913a (R13) for Linux and Windows
- Matlab 6.1.0.450 (R12.1) for Windows
- Octave 2.1.69


For Matlab 7 or later, igamma.m can be improved replacing all logical
operators & and | by their shortcut versions && and ||. This was
not done for backward compatibility reasons with earlier versions
of Matlab.



For earlier versions of Octave, include the two following lines
at the start of besselint.m:
    %  Disable column vector preference
    if exist('prefer_column_vectors'), prefer_column_vectors=0; end




Octave is always significantly slower than Matlab for besselint.m.
The script gettGJ executed  by Octave 2.1.69 suggested to set
tGJ=1374 in besselint.m. This is very much different from Matlab!
If speed is a real concern, then the user should change this parameter.
Based on total execution time of experiments.m, we suggest tGJ=100.
