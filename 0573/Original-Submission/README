c  this file comes in 9 sections, separated by a comment line having c
c  in column 1 and slashes in columns 2-72.  the first section con-
c  sists of these comments.  sections 2-5 contain single-precision 1966
c  ansi standard fortran source code, and sections 6-9 are double-
c  precision versions of sections 2-5.  comments in sections 4 and 8
c  describe an easy way to modify this code for use with fortran 77.
c  the 9 sections are as follows...
c
c     1. these comments.
c     2. single-prec. short test program.
c     3. single-prec. machine-dependent functions imdcon and rmdcon.
c     4. single-prec. machine-independent nl2sol modules.
c     5. single-prec. long test program.
c     6. double-prec. short test program.
c     7. double-prec. machine-dependent functions imdcon and rmdcon.
c     8. double-prec. machine-independent nl2sol modules.
c     9. double-prec. long test program.
c
c  the short test program (sections 2 and 6) amounts to the example in
c  section 3.2 of the description of toms algorithm 573 with an added
c  call on nl2sno.
c
c  depending on the computer used, it may be necessary to change the
c  data statements in sections 3 and 7 -- see section 3.12 of the
c  description of toms algorithm 573.  (the version of rmdcon in
c  section 3 is set for cdc computers, and that in section 8 is set for
c  ibm 360 and 370 computers.)
c
c  the first three modules in sections 4 and 8 are nl2sol, nl2sno, and
c  nl2itr.  the remaining modules follow in alphabetical order.
c
c  the long test program (sections 5 and 9) runs the tests reported in
c  table ii of the toms paper on nl2sol.  this program produces a
c  one-page summary on unit imdcon(2) and detailed output on unit
c  imdcon(1).  the latter may be suppressed by arranging for imdcon(1)
c  to return 0.
