Algorith XXX 

There are 11 files included with this package.

If you have problems with functions not being found e.g. erf, trunc,
log1p, chances you can edit norminc.h to get this fixed up.

README
norminc.h    -- header file with constant definitions
		log1p, trunc, erf problems can be fixed here
lnnorm.c     -- source file for double lnnorm(double x)
		computes the log of the normal distribution
		uses Algorithm 304
normal.c     -- source file for double norm(double x)
		computes the normal distribution function
		Algorithm 304
lnanorm.c    -- source file for double lnanorm(double x)
		computes the log of the normal distribution
		uses Algorithm 715
anorm.c      -- source file for double anorm(double x)
		computes the normal distribution
		Algorithm 715
lnenorm.c    -- source file for double lnenorm(double x)
		computes the log of the normal distribution
		uses built in error function/complement of the error function
enorm.c      -- source file for double enorm(double x)
		computes the normal distribution
		uses built in error function/complement of the error function
log1px.c     -- source file for double log1px(double x) for |x| << 1
	        computes log(1+x) via Taylor Series.  Use only with |x| << 1.
main.c	     -- driver program
sheppard.txt -- data file with values from Table IV of Sheppard [1939] as
		cited in the article.
makefile

The makefile will compile the code, which can then be run
with the command -main-.  This will generate the data in
the tables included in the accompanying article:
